T
HIS book is about practical ethics, that is, the application
of ethics or morality - 1 shall use the words interchangeably
- to practical issues like the treatment of ethnic minorities,
equality for women, the use of animals for food and research,
the preservation of the natural environment, abortion, euthanasia, and the obligation of the wealthy to help the poor. No
doubt the reader will want to get on to these issues without
delay; but there are some preliminaries that must be dealt with
at the start. In order to have a useful discussion within ethics,
it is necessary to say a little about ethics, so that we have a clear
understanding of what we are doing when we discuss ethical
questions. This first chapter therefore sets the stage for the remainder of the book. In order to prevent it from growing into
an entire volume itself, I have kept it brief. If at times it is
dogmatic, that is because I cannot take the space properly to
consider all the different conceptions of ethics that might be
opposed to the one I shall defend; but this chapter will at least
serve to reveal the assumptions on which the remainder of the
book is based.
WHAT ETHICS IS NOT
Some people think that morality is now out of date. They regard
morality as a system of nasty puritanical prohibitions, mainly
designed to stop people having fun. Traditional moralists claim
to be the defenders of morality in general, but they are really
defending a particular moral code. They have been allowed to
1 

preempt the field to such an extent that when a newspaper
headline reads BISHOP ATTACKS DECLINING MORAL STANDARDS, we expect to read yet again about promiscuity, homosexuality, pornography, and so on, and not about the puny
amounts we give as overseas aid to poorer nations, or our reckless indifference to the natural environment of our planet.
So the first thing to say about ethics is that it is not a set of
prohibitions particularly concerned with sex. Even in the era of
AIDS, sex raises no unique moral issues at all. Decisions about
sex may involve considerations of honesty, concern for others,
prudence, and so on, but there is nothing special about sex in
this respect, for the same could be said of decisions about driving
a car. (In fact, the moral issues raised by driving a car, both
from an environmental and from a safety point of view, are
much more serious than those raised by sex.) Accordingly, this
book contains no discussion of sexual morality. There are more
important ethical issues to be considered.
Second, ethics is not an ideal system that is noble in theory
but no good in practice. The reverse of this is closer to the truth:
an ethical judgment that is no good in practice must suffer from
a theoretical defect as well, for the whole point of ethical judgments is to guide practice.
Some people think that ethics is inapplicable to the real world
because they regard it as a system of short and simple rules like
'Do not lie', 'Do not steal', and 'Do not kill'. It is not surprising
that those who hold this view of ethics should also believe that
ethics is not suited to life's complexities. In unusual situations,
simple rules conflict; and even when they do not, following a
rule can lead to disaster. It may normally be wrong to lie, but
if you were living in Nazi Germany and the Gestapo came to
your door looking for Jews, it would surely be right to deny
the existence of the Jewish family hiding in your attic.
Like the failure of a restrictive sexual morality, the failure of
an ethic of simple rules must not be taken as a failure of ethics
as a whole. It is only a failure of one view of ethics, and not
2 

even an irremediable failure of that view. The deontologists -
those who think that ethics is a system of rules - can rescue
their position by finding more complicated and more specific
rules that do not conflict with each other, or by ranking the
rules in some hierarchical structure to resolve conflicts between
them. Moreover, there is a long-standing approach to ethics
that is quite untouched by the complexities that make simple
rules difficult to apply. This is the consequentialist view. Consequentialists start not with moral rules but with goals. They
assess actions by the extent to which they further these goals.
The best-known, though not the only, consequentialist theory
is utilitarianism. The classical utilitarian regards an action as
right if it produces as much or more of an increase in the happiness of all affected by it than any alternative action, and wrong
if it does not.
The consequences of an action vary according to the circumstances in which it is performed. Hence a utilitarian can never
properly be accused of a lack of realism, or of a rigid adherence
to ideals in defiance of practical experience. The utilitarian will
judge lying bad in some circumstances and good in others, depending on its consequences.
Third, ethics is not something intelligible only in the context
of religion. I shall treat ethics as entirely independent of religion.
Some theists say that ethics cannot do without religion because the very meaning of 'good' is nothing other than 'what
God approves'. Plato refuted a similar claim more than two
thousand years ago by arguing that if the gods approve of some
actions it must be because those actions are good, in which case
it cannot be the gods' approval that makes them good. The
alternative view makes divine approval entirely arbitrary : if the
gods had happened to approve of torture and disapprove of
helping our neighbours, torture would have been good and
helping our neighbours bad. Some modern theists have attempted to extricate themselves from this type of dilemma by
maintaining that God is good and so could not possibly approve
3 

of torture; but these theists are caught in a trap of their own
making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that
God is good? That God is approved of by God?
Traditionally, the more important link between religion and
ethics was that religion was thought to provide a reason for
doing what is right, the reason being that those who are virtuous
will be rewarded by an eternity of bliss while the rest roast in
hell. Not all religious thinkers have accepted this argument:
Immanuel Kant, a most pious Christian, scorned anything that
smacked of a self-interested motive for obeying the moral law.
We must obey it, he said, for its own sake. Nor do we have to
be Kantians to dispense with the motivation offered by traditional religion. There is a long line of thought that finds the
source of ethics in the attitudes of benevolence and sympathy
for others that most people have. This is, however, a complex
topic, and since it is the subject of the final chapter of this book
I shall not pursue it here. It is enough to say that our everyday
observation of our fellow human beings clearly shows that ethical behaviour does not require belief in heaven and hell.
The fourth, and last, claim about ethics that I shall deny in
this opening chapter is that ethics is relative or subjective. At
least, I shall deny these claims in some of the senses in which
they are often made. This point requires a more extended discussion than the other three.
Let us take first the oft-asserted idea that ethics is relative to
the society one happens to live in. This is true in one sense and
false in another. It is true that, as we have already seen in
discussing consequentialism, actions that are right in one situation because of their good consequences may be wrong in
another situation because of their bad consequences. Thus casual sexual intercourse may be wrong when it leads to the existence of children who cannot be adequately cared for, and not
wrong when, because of the existence of effective contraception,
it does not lead to reproduction at all. But this is only a superficial form of relativism. While it suggests that the applicability
4 

of a specific principle like 'Casual sex is wrong' may be relative
to time and place, it says nothing against such a principle being
objectively valid in specific circumstances, or against the universal applicability of a more general principle like 'Do what
increases happiness and reduces suffering.'
The more fundamental form of relativism became popular in
the nineteenth century when data on the moral beliefs and
practices of far-flung societies began pouring in. To the strict
reign of Victorian prudery the knowledge that there were places
where sexual relations between unmarried people were regarded as perfectly wholesome brought the seeds of a revolution
in sexual attitudes. It is not surprising that to some the new
knowledge suggested, not merely that the moral code of nineteenth-century Europe was not objectively valid, but that no
moral judgment can do more than reflect the customs of the
society in which it is made.
Marxists adapted this form of relativism to their own theories.
The ruling ideas of each period, they said, are the ideas of its
ruling class, and so the morality of a society is relative to its
dominant economic class, and thus indirectly relative to its economic basis. So they triumphantly refuted the claims of feudal
and bourgeois morality to objective, universal validity. But this
raises a problem: if all morality is relative, what is so special
about communism? Why side with the proletariat rather than
the bourgeoisie?
Engels dealt with this problem in the only way possible, by
abandoning relativism in favour of the more limited claim that
the morality of a society divided into classes will always be
relative to the ruling class, although the morality of a society
without class antagonisms could be a 'really human' morality.
This is no longer relativism at all. Nevertheless, Marxism, in a
confused sort of way, still provides the impetus for a lot of woolly
relativist ideas.
The problem that led Engels to abandon relativism defeats
ordinary ethical relativism as well. Anyone who has thought 

through a difficult ethical decision knows that being told what
our society thinks we ought to do does not settle the quandary.
We have to reach our own decision. The beliefs and customs
we were brought up with may exercise great influence on us,
but once we start to reflect upon them we can decide whether
to act in accordance with them, or to go against them.
The opposite view - that ethics is always relative to a particular society - has most implausible consequences. If our society
disapproves of slavery, while another society approves of it, we
have no basis to choose between these conflicting views. Indeed,
on a relativist analysis there is really no conflict - when I say
slavery is wrong I am really only saying that my society disapproves of slavery, and when the slaveowners from the other
society say that slavery is right, they are only saying that their
society approves of it. Why argue? Obviously we could both be
speaking the truth.
Worse still, the relativist cannot satisfactorily account for the
nonconformist. If 'slavery is wrong' means 'my society disapproves of slavery', then someone who lives in a society that
does not disapprove of slavery is, in claiming that slavery is
wrong, making a simple factual error. An opinion poll could
demonstrate the error of an ethical judgment. Would-be reformers are therefore in a parlous situation: when they set out
to change the ethical views of their fellow-citizens they are
necessarily mistaken; it is only when they succeed in winning
most of the society over to their own views that those views
become right.
These difficulties are enough to sink ethical relativism; ethical
subjectivism at least avoids making nonsense of the valiant efforts of would-be moral reformers, for it makes ethical judgments depend on the approval or disapproval of the person
making the judgment, rather than that person's society. There
are other difficulties, though, that at least some forms of ethical
subjectivism cannot overcome.
If those who say that ethics is subjective mean by this that
6 

when I say that cruelty to animals is wrong I am really only
saying that I disapprove of cruelty to animals, they are faced
with an aggravated form of one of the difficulties of relativism:
the inability to account for ethical disagreement. What was true
for the relativist of disagreement between people from different
societies is for the subjectivist true of disagreement between any
two people. I say cruelty to animals is wrong: someone else
says it is not wrong. If this means that I disapprove of cruelty
to animals and someone else does not, both statements may be
true and so there is nothing to argue about.
Other theories often described as 'subjectivist' are not open
to this objection. Suppose someone maintains that ethical judgments are neither true nor false because they do not describe
anything - neither objective moral facts, nor one's own subjective states of mind. This theory might hold that, as C. L.
Stevenson suggested, ethical judgments express attitudes, rather
than describe them, and we disagree about ethics because we
try, by expressing our own attitude, to bring our listeners to a
similar attitude. Or it might be, as R. M. Hare has urged, that
ethical judgments are prescriptions and therefore more closely
related to commands than to statements of fact. On this view
we disagree because we care about what people do. Those features of ethical argument that imply the existence of objective
moral standards can be explained away by maintaining that this
is some kind of error - perhaps the legacy of the belief that
ethics is a God-given system of law, or perhaps just another
example of our tendency to objectify our personal wants and
preferences. J. L. Mackie has defended this view.
Provided they are carefully distinguished from the crude form
of subjectivism that sees ethical judgments as descriptions of the
speaker's attitudes, these are plausible accounts of ethics. In
their denial of a realm of ethical facts that is part of the real
world, existing quite independently of us, they are no doubt
correct; but does it follow from this that ethical judgments are
immune from criticism, that there is no role for reason or ar7 

gument in ethics, and that, from the standpoint of reason, any
ethical judgment is as good as any other? I do not think it does,
and none of the three philosophers referred to in the previous
paragraph denies reason and argument a role in ethics, though
they disagree as to the significance of this role.
This issue of the role that reason can play in ethics is the
crucial point raised by the claim that ethics is subjective. The
non-existence of a mysterious realm of objective ethical facts
does not imply the non-existence of ethical reasoning. It may
even help, since if we could arrive at ethical judgments only by
intuiting these strange ethical facts, ethical argument would be
more difficult still. So what has to be shown to put practical
ethics on a sound basis is that ethical reasoning is possible. Here
the temptation is to say simply that the proof of the pudding
lies in the eating, and the proof that reasoning is possible in
ethics is to be found in the remaining chapters of this book; but
this is not entirely satisfactory. From a theoretical point of view
it is unsatisfactory because we might find ourselves reasoning
about ethics without really understanding how this can happen;
and from a practical point of view it is unsatisfactory because
our reasoning is more likely to go astray if we lack a grasp of
its foundations. I shall therefore attempt to say something about
how we can reason in ethics.
WHAT ETHICS IS: ONE VIEW
What follows is a sketch of a view of ethics that allows reason
an important role in ethical decisions. It is not the only possible
view of ethics, but it is a plausible view. Once again, however,
I shall have to pass over qualifications and objections worth a
chapter to themselves. To those who think these undiscussed
objections defeat the position I am advancing, I can only say,
again, that this whole chapter may be treated as no more than
a statement of the assumptions on which this book is based. In
8 

that way it will at least assist in giving a clear view of what I
take ethics to be.
What is it to make a moral judgment, or to argue about an
ethical issue, or to live according to ethical standards? How do
moral judgments differ from other practical judgments? Why
do we regard a woman's decision to have an abortion as raising
an ethical issue, but not her decision to change her job? What
is the difference between a person who lives by ethical standards
and one who doesn't?
All these questions are related, so we only need to consider
one of them; but to do this we need to say something about
the nature of ethics. Suppose that we have studied the lives of
a number of different people, and we know a lot about what
they do, what they believe, and so on. Can we then decide
which of them are living by ethical standards and which are
not?
We might think that the way to proceed here is to find out
who beljeves it wrong to lie, cheat, steal, and so on and does
not do any of these things, and who has no such beliefs, and
shows no such restraint in their actions. Then those in the first
group would be living according to ethical standards and those
in the second group would not be. But this procedure mistakenly
assimilates two distinctions: the first is the distinction between
living according to (what we judge to be) the right ethical standards and living according to (what we judge to be) mistaken
ethical standards; the second is the distinction between living
according to some ethical standards, and living according to no
ethical standards at all. Those who lie and cheat, but do not
believe what they are doing to be wrong, may be living according to ethical standards. They may believe, for any of a
number of possible reasons, that it is right to lie, cheat, steal,
and so on. They are not living according to conventional ethical
standards, but they may be living according to some other ethical standards.
This first attempt to distinguish the ethical from the non9 

ethical was mistaken, but we can learn from our mistakes. We
found that we must concede that those who hold unconventional ethical beliefs are still living according to ethical standards,
if they believe, for any reason, that it is right to do as they are doing.
The italicised condition gives us a clue to the answer we are
seeking. The notion of living according to ethical standards is
tied up with the notion of defending the way one is living, of
giving a reason for it, of justifying it. Thus people may do all
kinds of things we regard as wrong, yet still be living according
to ethical standards, if they are prepared to defend and justify
what they do. We may find the justification inadequate, and
may hold that the actions are wrong, but the attempt at justification, whether successful or not, is sufficient to bring the
person's conduct within the domain of the ethical as opposed
to the non-ethical. When, on the other hand, people cannot
put forward any justification for what they do, we may reject
their claim to be living according to ethical standards, even if
what they do is in accordance with conventional moral principles.
We can go further. If we are to accept that a person is living
according to ethical standards, the justification must be of a
certain kind. For instance, a justification in terms of self -interest
alone will not do. When Macbeth, contemplating the murder
of Duncan, admits that only 'vaulting ambition' drives him to
do it, he is admitting that the act cannot be justified ethically.
'So that I can be king in his place' is not a weak attempt at an
ethical justification for assassination; it is not the sort of reason
that counts as an ethical justification at all. Self-interested acts
must be shown to be compatible with more broadly based ethical principles if they are to be ethically defensible, for the notion
of ethics carries with it the idea of something bigger than the
individual. If I am to defend my conduct on ethical grounds, I
cannot point only to the benefits it brings me. I must address
myself to a larger audience.
From ancient times, philosophers and moralists have ex10 

pressed the idea that ethical conduct is acceptable from a point
of view that is somehow universal. The 'Golden Rule' attributed
to Moses, to be found in the book of Leviticus and subsequently
repeated by Jesus, tells us to go beyond our own personal interests and 'love thy neighbour as thyself - in other words, give
the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one's
own interests. The same idea of putting oneself in the position
of another is involved in the other Christian formulation of the
commandment, that we do to others as we would have them
do to us. The Stoics held that ethics derives from a universal
natural law. Kant developed this idea into his famous formula:
'Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same
time will that it should become a universal law.' Kant's theory
has itself been modified and developed by R. M. Hare, who sees
universalisability as a logical feature of moral judgments. The
eighteenth -century British philosophers Hutcheson, Hume, and
Adam Smith appealed to an imaginary 'impartial spectator' as
the test of a moral judgment, and this theory has its modern
version in the Ideal Observer theory. Utilitarians, from Jeremy
Bentham to J. J. C. Smart, take it as axiomatic that in deciding
moral issues 'each counts for one and none for more than one';
while John Rawls, a leading contemporary critic of utilitarianism, incorporates essentially the same axiom into his own theory
by deriving basic ethical principles from an imaginary choice in
which those choosing do not know whether they will be the
ones who gain or lose by the principles they select. Even Continental European philosophers like the existentialist Jean -Paul
Sartre and the critical theorist Jurgen Habermas, who differ in
many ways from their English-speaking colleagues - and from
each other - agree that ethics is in some sense universal.
One could argue endlessly about the merits of each of these
characterisations of the ethical; but what they have in common
is more important than their differences. They agree that an
ethicalj)rinciple cannot be justified in relation to any partial or
sectional group. Ethics takes a universal point of view. This does
r 1 1 

not mean that a particular ethical judgment must be universally
applicable. Circumstances alter causes, as we have seen. What
it does mean is that in making ethical judgments we go beyond
our own likes and dislikes. From an ethical point of view, the
fact that it is I who benefit from, say, a more equal distribution
of income and you who lose by it, is irrelevant. Ethics requires
us to go beyond T and 'you' to the universal law, the universalisable judgment, the standpoint of the impartial spectator
or ideal observer, or whatever we choose to call it.
Can we use this universal aspect of ethics to derive an ethical
theory that will give us guidance about right and wrong? Philosophers from the Stoics to Hare and Rawls have attempted
this. No attempt has met with general acceptance. The problem
is that if we describe the universal aspect of ethics in bare, formal
terms, a wide range of ethical theories, including quite irreconcilable ones, are compatible with this notion of universality;
if, on the other hand, we build up our description of the universal aspect of ethics so that it leads us ineluctably to one
particular ethical theory, we shall be accused of smuggling our
own ethical beliefs into our definition of the ethical - and this
definition was supposed to be broad enough, and neutral
enough, to encompass all serious candidates for the status of
'ethical theory'. Since so many others have failed to overcome
this obstacle to deducing an ethical theory from the universal
aspect of ethics, it would be foolhardy to attempt to do so in a
brief introduction to a work with a quite different aim. Nevertheless I shall propose something only a little less ambitious.
The universal aspect of ethics, I suggest, does provide a persuasive, although not conclusive, reason for taking a broadly
utilitarian position.
My reason for suggesting this is as follows. In accepting that
ethical judgments must be made from a universal point of view,
I am accepting that my own interests cannot, simply because
they are my interests, count more than the interests of anyone
else. Thus my very natural concern that my own interests be
12 

fcoked after must, when I think ethically, be extended to the
interests of others. Now, imagine that I am trying to decide
between two possible courses of action - perhaps whether to
eat all the fruits I have collected myself, or to share them with
others. Imagine, too, that I am deciding in a complete ethical
vacuum, that I know nothing of any ethical considerations - I
am, we might say, in a pre-ethical stage of thinking. How would
I make up my mind? One thing that would be still relevant
would be how the possible courses of action will affect my
interests. Indeed, if we define 'interests' broadly enough, so that
we count anything people desire as in their interests (unless it
is incompatible with another desire or desires), then it would
seem that at this pre-ethical stage, only one's own interests can
be relevant to the decision.
Suppose I then begin to think ethically, to the extent of recognising that my own interests cannot count for more, simply
because they are my own, than the interests of others. In place
of my own interests, I now have to take into account the interests of all those affected by my decision. This requires me to
weigh up all these interests and adopt the course of action most
likely to maximise the interests of those affected. Thus at least
at some level in my moral reasoning I must choose the course
of action that has the best consequences, on balance, for all
affected. (I say 'at some level in my moral reasoning' because,
as we shall see later, there are utilitarian reasons for believing
that we ought not to try to calculate these consequences for
every ethical decision we make in our daily lives, but only in
very unusual circumstances, or perhaps when we are reflecting
on our choice of general principles to guide us in future. In
other words, in the specific example given, at first glance one
might think it obvious that sharing the fruit that I have gathered
has better consequences for all affected than not sharing them.
This may in thp end also be the best general principle for us all
to adopt, but before we can have grounds for believing this to
be the case, we must also consider whether the effect of a general
r 13 

practice of sharing gathered fruits will benefit all those affected,
by bringing about a more equal distribution, or whether it will
reduce the amount of food gathered, because some will cease
to gather anything if they know that they will get sufficient from
their share of what others gather.)
The way of thinking I have outlined is a form of utilitarianism.
It differs from classical utilitarianism in that 'best consequences'
is understood as meaning what, on balance, furthers the interests of those affected, rather than merely what increases pleasure
and reduces pain. (It has, however, been suggested that classical
utilitarians like Bentham and John Stuart Mill used 'pleasure'
and 'pain' in a broad sense that allowed them to include achieving what one desired as a 'pleasure' and the reverse as a 'pain'.
If this interpretation is correct, the difference between classical
utilitarianism and utilitarianism based on interests disappears.)
What does this show? It does not show that utilitarianism
can be deduced from the universal aspect of ethics. There are
other ethical ideals - like individual rights, the sanctity of life,
justice, purity, and so on - that are universal in the required
sense, and are, at least in some versions, incompatible with
utilitarianism. It does show that we very swiftly arrive at an
initially utilitarian position once we apply the universal aspect
of ethics to simple, pre-ethical decision making. This, I believe,
places the onus of proof on those who seek to go beyond utilitarianism. The utilitarian position is a minimal one, a first base
that we reach by universalising self-interested decision making.
We cannot, if we are to think ethically, refuse to take this step.
If we are to be persuaded that we should go beyond utilitarianism and accept non-utilitarian moral rules or ideals, we need
to be provided with good reasons for taking this further step.
Until such reasons are produced, we have some grounds for
remaining utilitarians.
This tentative argument for utilitarianism corresponds to the
way in which I shall discuss practical issues in this book. I am
inclined to hold a utilitarian position, and to some extent the
14 

book may be taken as an attempt to indicate how a consistent
utilitarianism would deal with a number of controversial problems. But I shall not take utilitarianism as the only ethical position worth considering. I shall try to show the bearing of other
views, of theories of rights, of justice, of the sanctity of life, and
so on, on the problems discussed. In this way readers will be
able to come to their own conclusions about the relative merits
of utilitarian and non-utilitarian approaches, and about the
whole issue of the role of reason and argument in ethics.

EQUALITY AND ITS
IMPLICATIONS
THE BASIS OF EQUALITY
T
HE present century has seen dramatic changes in moral
attitudes. Most of these changes are still controversial. Abortion, almost everywhere prohibited thirty years ago, is now legal
in many countries (though it is still opposed by substantial and
respected sections of the population). The same is true of
changes in attitudes to sex outside marriage, homosexuality,
pornography, euthanasia, and suicide. Great as the changes
have been, no new consensus has been reached. The issues
remain controversial and it is possible to defend either side
without jeopardising one's intellectual or social standing.
Equality seems to be different. The change in attitudes to
inequality - especially racial inequality - has been no less sudden and dramatic than the change in attitudes to sex, but it has
been more complete. Racist assumptions shared by most Europeans at the turn of the century are now totally unacceptable,
at least in public life. A poet could not now write of 'lesser
breeds without the law', and retain - indeed enhance - his
reputation, as Rudyard Kipling did in 1897. This does not mean
that there are no longer any racists, but only that they must
disguise their racism if their views and policies are to have any
chance of general acceptance. Even South Africa has abandoned
apartheid. The principle that all humans are equal is now part
of the prevailing political and ethical orthodoxy. But what, exactly, does it mean and why do we accept it?
Once we go beyond the agreement that blatant forms of racial
16 

discrimination are wrong, once we question the basis of the
principle that all humans are equal and seek to apply this principle to particular cases, the consensus starts to weaken. One
sign of this was the furor that occurred during the 1970s over
the claims made by Arthur Jensen, professor of educational
psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and H. J.
Eysenck, professor of psychology at the University of London,
about genetically based variations in intelligence between different races. Many of the most forceful opponents of Jensen
and Eysenck assume that these claims, if sound, would justify
racial discrimination. Are they right? Similar questions can
be asked about research into differences between males and
females.
Another issue requiring us to think about the principle of
equality is 'affirmative action'. Some philosophers and lawyers
have argued that the principle of equality requires that when
allocating jobs or university places we should favour members
of disadvantaged minorities. Others have contended that the
same principle of equality rules out any discrimination on racial
grounds, whether for or against the worst-off members of society.
We can only answer these questions if we are clear about
what it is we intend to say, and can justifiably say, when we
assert that all humans are equal - hence the need for an inquiry
into the ethical foundations of the principle of equality.
When we say that all humans are equal, irrespective of race
or sex, what exactly are we claiming? Racists, sexists, and other
opponents of equality have often pointed out that, by whatever
test we choose, it simply is not true that all humans are equal.
Some are tall, some are short; some are good at mathematics,
others are poor at it; some can run 100 metres in ten seconds,
some take fifteen* or twenty; some would never intentionally
hurt another being, others would kill a stranger for $100 if they
could get away with it; some have emotional lives that touch
the heights of ecstasy and the depths of despair, while others
r 17 

live on a more even plane, relatively untouched by what goes
on around them. And so we could go on. The plain fact is that
humans differ, and the differences apply to so many characteristics that the search for a factual basis on which to erect the
principle of equality seems hopeless.
John Rawls has suggested, in his influential book A Theory of
Justice, that equality can be founded on the natural characteristics of human beings, provided we select what he calls a 'range
property'. Suppose we draw a circle on a piece of paper. Then
all points within the circle - this is the 'range' - have the property of being within the circle, and they have this property
equally, Some points may be closer to the centre and others
nearer the edge, but all are, equally, points inside the circle.
Similarly, Rawls suggests, the property of 'moral personality' is
a property that virtually all humans possess, and all humans
who possess this property possess it equally. By 'moral personality' Rawls does not mean 'morally good personality'; he is
using 'moral' in contrast to 'amoral'. A moral person, Rawls
says, must have a sense of justice. More broadly, one might say
that to be a moral person is to be the kind of person to whom
one can make moral appeals, with some prospect that the appeal
will be heeded.
Rawls maintains that moral personality is the basis of human
equality, a view that derives from his 'contract' approach to
justice. The contract tradition sees ethics as a kind of mutually
beneficial agreement - roughly, 'Don't hit me and I won't hit
you.' Hence only those capable of appreciating that they are not
being hit, and of restraining their own hitting accordingly, are
within the sphere of ethics.
There are problems with using moral personality as the basis
of equality. One objection is that having a moral personality is
a matter of degree. Some people are highly sensitive to issues
of justice and ethics generally; others, for a variety of reasons,
have only a limited awareness of such principles. The suggestion
that being a moral person is the minimum necessary for coming
18 

within the scope of the principle of equality still leaves it open
just where this minimal line is to be drawn. Nor is it intuitively
obvious why, if moral personality is so important, we should
not have grades of moral status, with rights and duties corresponding to the degree of refinement of one's sense of justice.
Still more serious is the objection that it is not true that all
humans are moral persons, even in the most minimal sense.
Infants and small children, along with some intellectually disabled humans, lack the required sense of justice. Shall we then
say that all humans are equal, except for very young or intellectually disabled ones? This is certainly not what we ordinarily
understand by the principle of equality. If this revised principle
implies that we may disregard the interests of very young or
intellectually disabled humans in ways that would be wrong if
they were older or more intelligent, we would need far stronger
arguments to induce us to accept it. (Rawls deals with infants
and children by including potential moral persons along with
actual ones within the scope of the principle of equality. But
this is an ad hoc device, confessedly designed to square his
theory with our ordinary moral intuitions, rather than something for which independent arguments can be produced. Moreover although Rawls admits that those with irreparable
intellectual disabilities 'may present a difficulty' he offers no
suggestions towards the solution of this difficulty.)
So the possession of 'moral personality' does not provide a
satisfactory basis for the principle that all humans are equal. I
doubt that any natural characteristic, whether a 'range property'
or not, can fulfil this function, for I doubt that there is any
morally significant property that all humans possess equally.
There is another possible line of defence for the belief that
there is a factual basis for a principle of equality that prohibits
racism and sexism. We can admit that humans differ as individuals, and yet insist that there are no morally significant differences between the races and sexes. Knowing that someone
is of African or European descent, female or male, does not >
19 

enable us to draw conclusions about her or his intelligence,
sense of justice, depth of feelings, or anything else that would
entitle us to treat her or him as less than equal. The racist claim
that people of European descent are superior to those of other
races in these capacities is in this sense false. The differences
between individuals in these respects are not captured by racial
boundaries. The same is true of the sexist stereotype that sees
women as emotionally deeper and more caring, but also less
rational, less aggressive, and less enterprising than men. Obviously this is not true of women as a whole. Some women are
emotionally shallower, less caring, and more rational, more
aggressive and, more enterprising than some men.
The fact that humans differ as individuals, not as races or
sexes, is important, and we shall return to it when we come to
discuss the implications of the claims made by Jensen, Eysenck,
and others; yet it provides neither a satisfactory principle of
equality nor an adequate defence against a more sophisticated
opponent of equality than the blatant racist or sexist. Suppose
that someone proposes that people should be given intelligence
tests and then classified into higher or lower status categories
on the basis of the results. Perhaps those who scored above 125
would be a slave-owning class; those scoring between 100 and
125 would be free citizens but lack the right to own slaves;
while those scoring below 100 would be made the slaves of
those who had scored above 125. A hierarchical society of this
sort seems as abhorrent as one based on race or sex; but if we
base our support for equality on the factual claim that differences
between individuals cut across racial and sexual boundaries, we
have no grounds for opposing this kind of inegalitarianism. For
this hierarchical society would be based on real differences between people.
We can reject this 'hierarchy of intelligence' and similar fantastic schemes only if we are clear that the claim to equality
does not rest on the possession of intelligence, moral personality,
rationality, or similar matters of fact. There is no logically com20 

pelling reason for assuming that a difference in ability between
two people justifies any difference in the amount of consideration we give to their interests. Equality is a basic ethical principle, not an assertion of fact. We can see this if we return to
our earlier discussion of the universal aspect of ethical judgments.
We saw in the previous chapter that when I make an ethical
judgment I must go beyond a personal or sectional point of view
and take into account the interests of all those affected. This
means that we weigh up interests, considered simply as interests
and not as my interests, or the interests of Australians, or of
people of European descent. This provides us with a basic principle of equality: the principle of equal consideration of interests.
The essence of the principle of equal consideration of interests
is that we give equal weight in our moral deliberations to the
like interests of all those affected by our actions. This means
that if only X and Y would be affected by a possible act, and if
X stands to lose more than Y stands to gain, it is better not to
do the act. We cannot, if we accept the principle of equal consideration of interests, say that doing the act is better, despite
the facts described, because we are more concerned about Y
than we are about X. What the principle really amounts to is
this: an interest is an interest, whoever's interest it may be.
We can make this more concrete by considering a particular
interest, say the interest we have in the relief of pain. Then the
principle says that the ultimate moral reason for relieving pain
is simply the undesirability of pain as such, and not the undesirability of X's pain, which might be different from the undesirability of Y's pain. Of course, X's pain might be more
undesirable than Y's pain because it is more painful, and then
the principle of equal consideration would give greater weight
to the relief of X's pain. Again, even wBere the pains are equal,
other factors might be relevant, especially if others are affected.
If there has been an earthquake we might give priority to the
relief of a dpctor's pain so she can treat other victims. But the
21 

doctor's pain itself counts only once, and with no added weighting. The principle of equal consideration of interests acts like a
pair of scales, weighing interests impartially. True scales favour
the side where the interest is stronger or where several interests
combine to< 1outweigh a smaller number of similar interests; but
they take no account of whose interests they are weighing.
From this point of view race is irrelevant to the consideration
of interests; for all that counts are the interests themselves. To
give less consideration to a specified amount of pain because
that pain was experienced by a member of a particular race
would be to make an arbitrary distinction. Why pick on race?
Why not on whether a person was born in a leap year? Or
whether there is more than one vowel in her surname? All
these characteristics are equally irrelevant to the undesirability
of pain from the universal point of view. Hence the principle
of equal consideration of interests shows straightforwardly why
the most blatant forms of racism, like that of the Nazis, are
wrong. For the Nazis were concerned only for the welfare of
members of the 'Aryan' race, and the sufferings of Jews, Gypsies,
and Slavs were of no concern to them.
The principle of equal consideration of interests is sometimes
thought to be a purely formal principle, lacking in substance
and too weak to exclude any inegalitarian practice. We have
already seen, however, that it does exclude racism and sexism,
at least in their most blatant forms. If we look at the impact of
the principle on the imaginary hierarchical society based on
intelligence tests we can see that it is strong enough to provide
a basis for rejecting this more sophisticated form of inegalitarianism, too.
The principle of equal consideration of interests prohibits
making our readiness to consider the interests of others depend
on their abilities or other characteristics, apart from the characteristic of having interests. It is true that we cannot know
where equal consideration of interests will lead us until we
know what interests people have, and this may vary according
22 

to their abilities or other characteristics. Consideration of the
interests of mathematically gifted children may lead us to teach
them advanced mathematics at an early age, which for different
children might be entirely pointless or positively harmful. But
the basic element, the taking into account of the person's interests, whatever they may be, must apply to everyone, irrespective of race, sex, or scores on an intelligence test. Enslaving
those who score below a certain line on an intelligence test
would not - barring extraordinary and implausible beliefs about
human nature - be compatible with equal consideration. Intelligence has nothing to do with many important interests that
humans have, like the interest in avoiding pain, in developing
one's abilities, in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, in
enjoying friendly and loving relations with others, and in being
free to pursue one's projects without unnecessary interference
from others. Slavery prevents the slaves from satisfying these
interests as they would want to; and the benefits it confers on
the slave-owners are hardly comparable in importance to the
harm it does to the slaves.
So the principle of equal consideration of interests is strong
enough to rule out an intelligence-based slave society as well
as cruder forms of racism and sexism. It also rules out discrimination on the grounds of disability, whether intellectual or
physical, in so far as the disability is not relevant to the interests
under consideration (as, for example, severe intellectual disability might be if we are considering a person's interest in voting
in an election). The principle of equal consideration of interests
therefore may be a defensible form of the principle that all
humans are equal, a form that we can use in discussing more
controversial issues about equality. Before we go on to these
topics, however, it will be useful to say a little more about the
nature of the principle.
Equal consideration of interests is a minimal principle of
equality in the sense that it does not dictate equal treatment.
Take a relatively straightforward example of an interest, the
23 

interest in having physical pain relieved. Imagine that after an
earthquake I come across two victims, one with a crushed leg,
in agony, and one with a gashed thigh, in slight pain. I have
only two shots of morphine left. Equal treatment would suggest
that I give one to each injured person, but one shot would not
do much to relieve the pain of the person with the crushed leg.
She would still be in much more pain than the other victim,
and even after I have given her one shot, giving her the second
shot would bring greater relief than giving a shot to the person
in slight pain. Hence equal consideration of interests in this
situation leads to what some may consider an inegalitarian result: two shots of morphine for one person, and none for the
other.
There is a still more controversial inegalitarian implication of
the principle of equal consideration of interests. In the case
above, although equal consideration of interests leads to unequal treatment, this unequal treatment is an attempt to produce
a more egalitarian result. By giving the double dose to the more
seriously injured person, we bring about a situation in which
there is less difference in the degree of suffering felt by the two
victims than there would be if we gave one dose to each. Instead
of ending up with one person in considerable pain and one in
no pain, we end up with two people in slight pain. This is in
line with the principle of declining marginal utility, a principle
well-known to economists, which states that for a given individual, a set amount of something is more useful when people
have little of it than when they have a lot. If I am struggling to
survive on 200 grams of rice a day, and you provide me with
an extra fifty grams per day, you have improved my position
significantly; but if I already have a kilo of rice per day, I won't
care much about the extra fifty grams. When marginal utility
is taken into account the principle of equal consideration of
interests inclines us towards an equal distribution of income,
and to that extent the egalitarian will endorse its conclusions.
What is likely to trouble the egalitarian about the principle of
24 

equal consideration of interests is that there are circumstances
in which the principle of declining marginal utility does not
hold or is overridden by countervailing factors.
We can vary the example of the earthquake victims to illustrate this point. Let us say, again, that there are two victims,
one more severely injured than the other, but this time we shall
say that the more severely injured victim, A, has lost a leg and
is in danger of losing a toe from her remaining leg; while the
less severely injured victim, B, has an injury to her leg, but the
limb can be saved. We have medical supplies for only one person. If we use them on the more severely injured victim the
most we can do is save her toe, whereas if we use them on the
less severely injured victim we can save her leg. In other words,
we assume that the situation is as follows: without medical
treatment, A loses a leg and a toe, while B loses only a leg; if
we give the treatment to A, A loses a leg and B loses a leg; if we
give the treatment to B, A loses a leg and a toe, while B loses
nothing.
Assuming that it is worse to lose a leg than it is to lose a toe
(even when that toe is on one's sole remaining foot) the principle of declining marginal utility does not suffice to give us the
right answer in this situation. We will do more to further the
interests, impartially considered, of those affected by our actions
if we use our limited resources on the less seriously injured
victim than on the more seriously injured one. Therefore this
is what the principle of equal consideration of interests leads us
to do. Thus equal consideration of interests can, in special cases,
widen rather than narrow the gap between two people at different levels of welfare. It is for this reason that the principle is
a minimal principle of equality, rather than a thoroughgoing
egalitarian principle. A more thoroughgoing form of egalitarianism would, however, be difficult to justify, both in general
terms and in its application to special cases of the kind just
described.
Minimal as it is, the principle of equal consideration of in25 

terests can seem too demanding in some cases. Can any of us
really give equal consideration to the welfare of our family and
the welfare of strangers? This question will be dealt with in
Chapter 9, when we consider our obligations to assist those in
need in poorer parts of the world. I shall try to show then that
it does not force us to abandon the principle, although the
principle may force us to abandon some other views we hold.
Meanwhile we shall see how the principle assists us in discussing
some of the controversial issues raised by demands for equality.
EQUALITY AND GENETIC DIVERSITY
In 1969 Arthur Jensen published a long article in the Harvard
Educational Review entitled 'How Much Can We Boost IQ and
Scholastic Achievement?' One short section of the article discussed the probable causes of the undisputed fact that - on
average - African Americans do not score as well as most other
Americans in standard IQ tests. Jensen summarised the upshot
of this section as follows:
All we are left with are various lines of evidence, no one of which
is definitive alone, but which, viewed altogether, make it a not
unreasonable hypothesis that genetic factors are strongly implicated in the average negro-white intelligence difference. The
preponderance of evidence is, in my opinion, less consistent with
a strictly environmental hypothesis than with a genetic hypothesis, which, of course, does not exclude the influence of environment or its interaction with genetic factors.
This heavily qualified statement comes in the midst of a detailed
review of a complex scientific subject, published in a scholarly
journal. It would hardly have been surprising if it passed unnoticed by anyone but scientists working in the area of psychology or genetics. Instead it was widely reported in the
popular press as an attempt to defend racism on scientific
grounds. Jensen was accused of spreading racist propaganda
and likened to Hitler. His lectures were shouted down and stu26 

dents demanded that he be dismissed from his university post.
H. J. Eysenck, a British professor of psychology who supported
Jensen's theories received similar treatment, in Britain and Australia as well as in the United States. Interestingly, Eysenck's
argument did not suggest that those of European descent have
the highest average intelligence among Americans; instead, he
noted some evidence that Americans of Japanese and Chinese
descent do better on tests of abstract reasoning (despite coming
from backgrounds lower on the socioeconomic scale) than
Americans of European descent.
The opposition to genetic explanations of alleged racial differences in intelligence is only one manifestation of a more
general opposition to genetic explanations in other socially sensitive areas. It closely parallels, for instance, initial feminist hostility to the idea that there are biological factors behind male
dominance. (The second wave of the feminist movement seems
to be more willing to entertain the idea that biological differences between the sexes are influential in, for example, greater
male aggression and stronger female caring behaviour.) The
opposition to genetic explanations also has obvious links with
the intensity of feeling aroused by sociobiological approaches
to the study of human behaviour. The worry here is that if
human social behaviour is seen as deriving from that of other
social mammals, we shall come to think of hierarchy, male
dominance, and inequality as part of our evolved nature, and
as unchangeable. More recently, the commencement of the international scientific project that is designed to map the human
genome - that is, to provide a detailed scientific description of
the genetic code typical of human beings - has attracted protests
because of apprehension over what such a map might reveal
about genetic differences between humans, and the use to which
such information might be put.
It would be inappropriate for me to attempt to assess the
scientific merits of biological explanations of human behaviour
in general, or of racial or sexual differences in particular. My
27 

concern is rather with the implications of these theories for the
ideal of equality. For this purpose it is not necessary for us to
establish whether the theories are right. All we have to ask is:
suppose that one ethnic group does turn out to have a higher
average IQ than another, and that part of this difference has a
genetic basis. Would this mean that racism is defensible, and
we have to reject the principle of equality? A similar question
can be asked about the impact of theories of biological differences between the sexes. In neither case does the question assume that the theories are sound. It would be most unfortunate
if our scepticism about such things led us to neglect these questions and then unexpected evidence turned up confirming the
theories, with the result that a confused and unprepared public
took the theories to have implications for the ideal of equality
that they do not have.
I shall begin by considering the implications of the view that
there is a difference in the average IQ of two different ethnic
groups, and that genetic factors are responsible for at least a
part of this difference. I shall then consider the impact of alleged
differences in temperament and ability between the sexes.
Racial Differences and Racial Equality
Let us suppose, just for the sake of exploring the consequences,
that evidence accumulates supporting the hypothesis that there
are differences in intelligence between the different ethnic
groups of human beings. (We should not assume that this would
mean that Europeans come out on top. As we have already
seen, there is some evidence to the contrary.) What significance
would this have for our views about racial equality?
First a word of caution. When people talk of differences in
intelligence between ethnic groups, they are usually referring
to differences in scores on standard IQ tests. Now 'IQ' stands
for 'intelligence quotient' but this does not mean that an IQ test
really measures what we mean by 'intelligence' in ordinary
28 

contexts. Obviously there is some correlation between the two:
if schoolchildren regarded by their teachers as highly intelligent
did not generally score better on IQ tests than schoolchildren
regarded as below normal intelligence, the tests would have to
be changed - as indeed they were changed in the past. But this
does not show how close the correlation is, and since our ordinary concept of intelligence is vague, there is no way of telling.
Some psychologists have attempted to overcome this difficulty
by simply defining 'intelligence' as 'what intelligence tests measure', but this merely introduces a new concept of 'intelligence',
which is easier to measure than our ordinary notion but may
be quite different in meaning. Since 'intelligence' is a word in
everyday use, to use the same word in a different sense is a sure
path to confusion. What we should talk about, then, is differences in IQ, rather than differences in intelligence, since this is
all that the available evidence could support.
The distinction between intelligence and scores on IQ tests
has led some to conclude that IQ is of no importance; this is
the opposite, but equally erroneous, extreme to the view that
IQ is identical with intelligence. IQ is important in our society.
One's IQ is a factor in one's prospects of improving one's occupational status, income, or social class. If there are genetic
factors in racial differences in IQ, there will be genetic factors
in racial differences in occupational status, income, and social
class. So if we are interested in equality, we cannot ignore IQ.
When people of different racial origin are given IQ tests, there
tend to be differences in the average scores they get. The existence of such differences is not seriously disputed, even by those
w ho most vigorously opposed the views put forward by Jensen
and Eysenck. What is hotly disputed is whether the differences i
are primarily to be explained by heredity or by environment -
in other words, whether they reflect innate differences between
different groups of human beings, or whether they are due to
the different social and educational situations in which these
groups find themselves. Almost everyone accepts that environ29 

mental factors do play a role in IQ differences between groups;
the debate is over whether they can explain all or virtually all
of the differences.
Let us suppose that the genetic hypothesis turns out to be
correct (making this supposition, as I have said, not because we
believe it is correct but in order to explore its implications);
what would be the implications of genetically based differences
in IQ between different races? I believe that the implications of
this supposition are less drastic than they are often supposed to
be and give no comfort to genuine racists. I have three reasons
for this view.
First, the genetic hypothesis does not imply that we should
reduce our efforts to overcome other causes of inequality between people, for example, in the quality of housing and schooling available to less well-off people. Admittedly, if the genetic
hypothesis is correct, these efforts will not bring about a situation in which different racial groups have equal IQs. But this
is no reason for accepting a situation in which any people are
hindered by their environment from doing as well as they can.
Perhaps we should put special efforts into helping those who
start from a position of disadvantage, so that we end with a
more egalitarian result.
Second, the fact that the average IQ of one racial group is a
few points higher than that of another does not allow anyone
to say that all members of the higher IQ group have higher IQs
than all members of the lower IQ group - this is clearly false
for any racial group - or that any particular individual in the
higher IQ group has a higher IQ than a particular individual in
the lower IQ group - this will often be false. The point is that
these figures are averages and say nothing about individuals.
There will be a substantial overlap in IQ scores between the two
groups. So whatever the cause of the difference in average IQs,
it will provide no justification for racial segregation in education
or any other field. It remains true that members of different
30 

racial groups must be treated as individuals, irrespective of their
race.
The third reason why the genetic hypothesis gives no support
for racism is the most fundamental of the three. It is simply
that, as we saw earlier, the principle of equality is not based on
any actual equality that all people share. I have argued that the
only defensible basis for the principle of equality is equal consideration of interests, and I have also suggested that the most
important human interests - such as the interest in avoiding
pain, in developing one's abilities, in satisfying basic needs for
food and shelter, in enjoying warm personal relationships, in
being free to pursue one's projects without interference, and
many others - are not affected by differences in intelligence.
We can be even more confident that they are not affected by
differences in IQ. Thomas Jefferson, who drafted the ringing
assertion of equality with which the American Declaration of
Independence begins, knew this. In reply to an author who had
endeavoured to refute the then common view that Africans lack
intelligence, he wrote:
Be assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I
do, to see a complete refutation of the doubts I have myself
entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted
to them by nature, and to find that they are on a par with
ourselves... but whatever be their degree of talent, it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to
others in understanding, he was not therefore lord of the property
or person of others.
Jefferson was right. Equal status does not depend on intelligence. Racists who maintain the contrary are in peril of being
forced to kneel before the next genius they encounter.
These three reasons suffice to show that claims that for genetic
reasons one racial group is not as good as another at IQ tests
do not provide grounds for denying the moral principle that all
humans are equal. The third reason, however, has further ram31 

ifications that we shall follow up after discussing differences
between the sexes.
Sexual Differences and Sexual Equality
The debates over psychological differences between females and
males are not about IQ in general. On general IQ tests there are
no consistent differences in the average scores of females and
males. But IQ tests measure a range of different abilities, and
when we break the results down according to the type of ability
measured, we do find significant differences between the sexes.
There is some evidence suggesting that females have greater
verbal ability than males. This involves being better able to
understand complex pieces of writing and being more creative
with words. Males, on the other hand, appear to have greater
mathematical ability, and also do better on tests involving what
is known as 'visual-spatial' ability. An example of a task requiring visual-spatial ability is one in which the subject is asked
to find a shape, say a square, which is embedded or hidden in
a more complex design.
We shall discuss the significance of these relatively minor
differences in intellectual abilities shortly. The sexes also differ
markedly in one major non-intellectual characteristic: aggression. Studies conducted on children in several different cultures
have borne out what parents have long suspected: boys are
more likely to play roughly, attack each other and fight back
when attacked, than girls. Males are readier to hurt others than
females; a tendency reflected in the fact that almost all violent
criminals are male. It has been suggested that aggression is
associated with competitiveness and the drive to dominate others and get to the top of whatever pyramid one is a part of. In
contrast, females are readier to adopt a role that involves caring
for others.
These are the major psychological differences that have repeatedly been observed in many studies of females and males.
32 

What is the origin of these differences? Once again the rival
explanations are environmental versus biological, nurture versus nature. Although this question of origin is important in some
special contexts, it was given too much weight by the first wave
of feminists who assumed that the case for women's liberation
rested on acceptance of the environmental side of the controversy. What is true of racial discrimination holds here, too:
discrimination can be shown to be wrong whatever the origin
of the known psychological differences. But first let us look
briefly at the rival explanations.
Anyone who has had anything to do with children will know
that in all sorts of ways children learn that the sexes have different roles. Boys get trucks or guns for their birthday presents;
girls get dolls or brush and comb sets. Girls are put into dresses
and told how nice they look; boys are dressed in jeans and
praised for their strength and daring. Children's books almost
invariably used to portray fathers going out to work while mothers clean the house and cook the dinner; some still do, although
in many countries feminist criticisms of this type of literature
have had some impact.
Social conditioning exists, certainly, but does it explain the
differences between the sexes? It is, at best, an incomplete explanation. We still need to know why our society - and not just
ours, but practically every human society - should shape children in this way. One popular answer is that in earlier, simpler
societies, the sexes had different roles because women had to
breast-feed their children during the long period before weaning. This meant that the women stayed closer to home while
the men went out to hunt. As a result females evolved a more
social and emotional character, while males became tougher
and more aggressive. Because physical strength and aggression
were the ultimate forms of power in these simple societies, males
became dominant. The sex roles that exist today are, on this
view, an inheritance from these simpler circumstances, an inheritance that became obsolete once technology made it possible
33 

for the weakest person to operate a crane that lifts fifty tons, or
fire a missile that kills millions. Nor do women have to be tied
to home and children in the way they used to be, since a woman
can now combine motherhood and a career.
The alternative view is that while social conditioning plays
some role in determining psychological differences between the
sexes, biological factors are also at work. The evidence for this
view is particularly strong in respect of aggression. In The Psychology of Sex Differences, Eleanor Emmons Maccoby and Carol
Nagy Jacklin give four grounds for their belief that the greater
aggression of males has a biological component:
1 Males are more aggressive than females in all human societies
in which the difference has been studied.
2 Similar differences are found in humans and in apes and other
closely related animals.
3 The differences are found in very young children, at an age
when there is no evidence of any social conditioning in this
direction (indeed Maccoby and Jacklin found some evidence
that boys are more severely punished for showing aggression
than girls).
4 Aggression has been shown to vary according to the level of
sex hormones, and females become more aggressive if they
receive male hormones.
The evidence for a biological basis of the differences in visualspatial ability is a little more complicated, but it consists largely
of genetic studies that suggest that this ability is influenced by
a recessive sex-linked gene. As a result, it is estimated, approximately 50 per cent of males have a genetic advantage in situations demanding visual-spatial ability, but only 25 per cent
of females have this advantage.
Evidence for and against a biological factor in the superior
verbal ability of females and the superior mathematical ability
of males is, at present, too weak to suggest a conclusion one
way or the other.
Adopting the strategy we used before in discussing race and
IQ, I shall not go further into the evidence for and against these
34 

biological explanations of differences between males and females. Instead I shall ask what the implications of the biological
hypotheses would be.
The differences in the intellectual strengths and weaknesses
of the sexes cannot explain more than a minute proportion of
the difference in positions that males and females hold in our
society. It might explain why, for example, there should be more
males than females in professions like architecture and engineering, professions that may require visual-spatial ability; but
even in these professions, the magnitude of the differences in
numbers cannot be explained by the genetic theory of visualspatial ability. This theory suggests that half as many females
are as genetically advantaged in this area as males, which would
account for the lower average scores of females in tests of visualspatial ability, but cannot account for the fact that in most countries there are not merely twice as many males as females in
architecture and engineering, but at least ten times as many.
Moreover, if superior visual-spatial ability explains the male
dominance of architecture and engineering, why isn't there a
corresponding female advantage in professions requiring high
verbal ability? It is true that there are more women journalists
than engineers, and probably more women have achieved lasting fame as novelists than in any other area of life; yet female
journalists and television commentators continue to be outnumbered by males, outside specifically 'women's subjects' such
as cookery and child care. So even if one accepts biological
explanations for the patterning of these abilities, one can still
argue that women do not have the same opportunities as men
to make the most of the abilities they have.
What of differences in aggression? One's first reaction might
be that feminists should be delighted with the evidence on this
point - what better way could there be of showing the superiority of females than by demonstrating their greater reluctance
to hurt others? But the fact that most violent criminals are male
may be only one side of greater male aggression. The other side
35 

could be greater male competitiveness, ambition, and drive to
achieve power. This would have different, and for feminists less
welcome, implications. Some years ago an American sociologist,
Steven Goldberg, built a provocatively entitled book, The Inevitability of Patriarchy, around the thesis that the biological basis
of greater male aggression will always make it impossible to
bring about a society in which women have as much political
power as men. From this claim it is easy to move to the view
that women should accept their inferior position in society and
not strive to compete with males, or to bring up their daughters
to compete with males in these respects; instead women should
return to their traditional sphere of looking after the home and
children. This is just the kind of argument that has aroused the
hostility of some feminists to biological explanations of male
dominance.
As in the case of race and IQ, the moral conclusions alleged
to follow from the biological theories do not really follow from
them at all. Similar arguments apply.
First, whatever the origin of psychological differences between the sexes, social conditioning can emphasise or soften
these differences. As Maccoby and Jacklin stress, the biological
bias towards, say, male visual-spatial superiority is really a
greater natural readiness to learn these skills. Where women
are brought up to be independent, their visual-spatial ability is
much higher than when they are kept at home and dependent
on males. This is no doubt true of other differences as well.
Hence feminists may well be right to attack the way in which
we encourage girls and boys to develop in distinct directions,
even if this encouragement is not itself responsible for creating
psychological differences between the sexes, but only reinforces
innate predispositions.
Second, whatever the origin of psychological differences between the sexes, they exist only when averages are taken, and
some females are more aggressive and have better visual-spatial
ability than some males. We have seen that the genetic hypo36 

thesis offered in explanation of male visual-spatial superiority
itself suggests that a quarter of all females will have greater
natural visual-spatial ability than half of all males. Our own
observations should convince us that there are females who are
also more aggressive than some males. So, biological explanations or not, we are never in a position to say: 'You're a woman,
so you can't become an engineer', or 'Because you are female,
you will not have the drive and ambition needed to succeed in
politics.' Nor should we assume that no male can possibly have
sufficient gentleness and warmth to stay at home with the children while their mother goes out to work. We must assess
people as individuals, not merely lump them into 'female' and
'male' if we are to find out what they are really like; and we
must keep the roles occupied by females and males flexible if
people are to be able to do what they are best suited for.
The third reason is, like the previous two, parallel to the
reasons I have given for believing that a biological explanation
of racial differences in IQ would not justify racism. The most
important human interests are no more affected by differences
in aggression than they are by differences in intelligence. Less
aggressive people have the same interest in avoiding pain,
developing their abilities, having adequate food and shelter,
enjoying good personal relationships, and so on, as more aggressive people. There is no reason why more aggressive people
ought to be rewarded for their aggression with higher salaries
and the ability to provide better for these interests.
Since aggression, unlike intelligence, is not generally regarded
as a desirable trait, the male chauvinist is hardly likely to deny
that greater aggression in itself provides no ethical justification
of male supremacy. He may, however, offer it as an explanation,
rather than a justification, of the fart that males hold most of
the leading positions in politics, business, the universities and
other areas in which people of both sexes compete for power
and status. He may then go on to suggest that this shows that
the present situation is merely the result of competition between
37 

males and females under conditions of equal opportunity.
Hence, it is not, he may say, unfair. This suggestion raises the
further ramifications of biological differences between people
that, as I said at the close of our discussion of the race and IQ
issue, need to be followed up in more depth.
FROM EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO EQUALITY
OF CONSIDERATION
In most Western societies large differences in income and social
status are commonly thought to be all right, as long as they
were brought into being under conditions of equal opportunity.
The idea is that there is no injustice in Jill earning $200,000
and Jack earning $20,000, as long as Jack had his chance to
be where Jill is today. Suppose that the difference in income is
due to the fact that Jill is a doctor whereas Jack is a farm worker.
This would be acceptable if Jack had the same opportunity as
Jill to be a doctor, and this is taken to mean that Jack was not
kept out of medical school because of his race, or religion, or
a disability that was irrelevant to his ability to be a doctor, or
something similar - in effect, if Jack's school results had been
as good as Jill's, he would have been able to study medicine,
become a doctor, and earn $200,000 a year. Life, on this view,
is a kind of race in which it is fitting that the winners should
get the prizes, as long as all get an equal start. The equal start
represents equality of opportunity and this, some say, is as far
as equality should go.
To say that Jack and Jill had equal opportunities to become
a doctor, because Jack would have got into medical school if
his results had been as good as Jill's, is to take a superficial view
of equal opportunity that will not stand up to further probing.
We need to ask why Jack's results were not as good as Jill's.
Perhaps his education up to that point had been inferior - bigger
classes, less qualified teachers, inadequate resources, and so on.
If so, he was not competing on equal terms with Jill after all.
38 

Genuine equality of opportunity requires us to ensure that
schools give the same advantages to everyone.
Making schools equal would be difficult enough, but it is the
easiest of the tasks that await a thoroughgoing proponent of
equal opportunity. Even if schools are the same, some children
will be favoured by the kind of home they come from. A quiet
room to study, plenty of books, and parents who encourage
their child to do well at school could explain why Jill succeeds
where Jack, forced to share a room with two younger brothers
and put up with his father's complaints that he is wasting his
time with books instead of getting out and earning his keep,
does not. But how does one equalise a home? Or parents?
Unless we are prepared to abandon the traditional family setting
and bring up our children in communal nurseries, we can't.
This might be enough to show the inadequacy of equal opportunity as an ideal of equality, but the ultimate objection -
the one that connects with our previous discussion of equality
- is still to come. Even if we did rear our children communally,
as on a kibbutz in Israel, they would inherit different abilities
and character traits, including different levels of aggression and
different IQs. Eliminating differences in the child's environment
would not affect differences in genetic endowment. True, it
might reduce the disparity between, say, IQ scores, since it is
likely that, at present, social differences accentuate genetic differences; but the genetic differences would remain and on most
estimates they are a major component of the existing differences
in IQ. (Remember that we are now talking of individuals. We
do not know if race affects IQ, but there is little doubt that
differences in IQ between individuals of the same race are, in
part, genetically determined.)
So equality of opportunity is not an attractive ideal. It rewards
the lucky, who inherit those abilities that allow them to pursue
interesting and lucrative careers. It penalises the unlucky, whose
genes make it very hard for them to achieve similar success.
We can now fit our earlier discussion of race and sex differ39 

ences into a broader picture. Whatever the facts about the social
or genetic basis of racial differences in IQ, removing social disadvantages will not suffice to bring about an equal or a just
distribution of income - not an equal distribution, because those
who inherit the abilities associated with high IQ will continue
to earn more than those who do not; and not a just distribution
because distribution according to the abilities one inherits is
based on an arbitrary form of selection that has nothing to do
with what people deserve or need. The same is true of visualspatial ability and aggression, if these do lead to higher incomes
or status. If, as I have argued, the basis of equality is equal
consideration of interests, and the most important human interests have little or nothing to do with these factors, there is
something questionable about a society in which income and
social status correlate to a significant degree with them.
When we pay people high salaries for programming computers and low salaries for cleaning offices, we are, in effect,
paying people for having a high IQ, and this means that we are
paying people for something determined in part before they are
b om and almost wholly determined before they reach an age
at which they are responsible for their actions. From the point
of view of justice and utility there is something wrong here.
Both would be better served by a society that adopted the famous Marxist slogan: 'From each according to his ability, to
each according to his needs.' If this could be achieved, the
differences between the races and sexes would lose their social
significance. Only then would we have a society truly based on
the principle of equal consideration of interests.
Is it realistic to aim at a society that rewards people according
to their needs rather than their IQ, aggression, or other inherited
abilities? Don't we have to pay people more to be doctors or
lawyers or university professors, to do the intellectually demanding work that is essential for our well-being?
There are difficulties in paying people according to their needs
rather than their inherited abilities. If one country attempts to
40 

introduce such a scheme while others do not, the result is likely
to be some kind of 'brain drain'. We have already seen this, on
a small scale, in the number of scientists and doctors who have
left Britain to work in the United States - not because Britain
does pay people according to need rather than inherited abilities,
but because these sections of the community, though relatively
well-paid by British standards, were much better paid in the
United States. If any one country were to make a serious attempt
to equalise the salaries of doctors and manual workers, there
can be no doubt that the number of doctors emigrating would
greatly increase. This is part of the problem of 'socialism in one
country'. Marx expected the socialist revolution to be a worldwide one. When the Russian Marxists found that their revolution had not sparked off the anticipated world revolution,
they had to adapt Marxist ideas to this new situation. They did
so by harshly restricting freedom, including the freedom to emigrate. Without these restrictions, during the communist period
in the Soviet Union and other communist states, and despite
the considerable pay differentials that still did exist in those
nations when under communist rule, and that continue to exist
in the remaining communist countries, there would have been
a crippling outflow of skilled people to the capitalist nations,
which rewarded skill more highly.1
 But if 'socialism in one
country' requires making the country an armed camp, with
border guards keeping watch on the citizens within as well as
the enemy without, socialism may not be worth the price.
To allow these difficulties to lead us to the conclusion that
we can do nothing to improve the distribution of income that
now exists in capitalist countries would, however, be too pessimistic. There is, in the more affluent Western nations, a good
1 According to one observer, salary differentials in China are quite steep, in
some areas steeper than in Western nations. For instance, a full professor
gets almost seven times as much as a junior lecturer, whereas in Britain,
Australia, or the United States, the ratio is more like three to one. See Simon
Leys, Chinese Shadows (New York, 1977).
41

deal of scope for reducing pay differentials before the point is
reached at which significant numbers of people begin to think
of emigrating. This is, of course, especially true of those countries, like the United States, where pay differentials are presently
very great. It is here that pressure for a more equitable distribution can best be applied.
What of the problems of redistribution within a single nation?
There is a popular belief that if we did not pay people a lot of
money to be doctors or university professors, they would not
undertake the studies required to achieve these positions. I do
not know what evidence there is in support of this assumption,
but it seems to me highly dubious. My own salary is considerably
higher than the salaries of the people employed by the university
to mow the lawns and keep the grounds clean, but if our salaries
were identical I would still not want to swap positions with
them - although their jobs are a lot more pleasant than some
lowly paid work. Nor do I believe that my doctor would jump
at a chance to change places with his receptionist if their salaries
did not differ. It is true that my doctor and I have had to study
for several years to get where we are, but I at least look back
on my student years as one of the most enjoyable periods of
my life.
Although I do not think it is because of the money that people
choose to become doctors rather than receptionists, there is one
qualification to be made to the suggestion that payment should
be based on need rather than ability. It must be admitted that
the prospect of earning more money sometimes leads people to
make greater efforts to use the abilities they have, and these
greater efforts can benefit patients, customers, students, or the
public as a whole. It might therefore be worth trying to reward
effort, which would mean paying people more if they worked
near the upper limits of their abilities, whatever those abilities
might be. This, however, is quite different from paying people
for the level of ability they happen to have, which is something
they cannot themselves control. As Jeffrey Gray, a British pro42
I 

fessor of psychology, has written, the evidence for genetic control of IQ suggests that to pay people differently for 'upper-class'
and 'lower-class' jobs is 'a wasteful use of resources in the guise
of "incentives" that either tempt people to do what is beyond
their powers or reward them more for what they would do
anyway'.
We have, up to now, been thinking of people such as university professors, who (at least in some countries) are paid by
the government, and doctors, whose incomes are determined
either by government bodies, where there is some kind of national health service, or by the government protection given to
professional associations like a medical association, which enables the profession to exclude those who might seek to advertise their services at a lower cost. These incomes are therefore
already subject to government control and could be altered
without drastically changing the powers of government. The
private business sector of the economy is a different matter.
Business people who are quick to seize an opportunity will,
under any private enterprise system, make more money than
their rivals or, if they are employed by a large corporation, may
be promoted faster. Taxation can help to redistribute some of
this income, but there are limits to how effective a steeply progressive tax system can be - there almost seems to be a law to
the effect that the higher the rate of tax, the greater the amount
of tax avoidance.
So do we have to abolish private enterprise if we are to eliminate undeserved wealth? That suggestion raises issues too large
to be discussed here; but it can be said that private enterprise
has a habit of reasserting itself under the most inhospitable
conditions. As the Russians and East Europeans soon found,
communist societies still had their black markets, and if you
wanted your plumbing fixed swiftly it was advisable to pay a
bit extra on the side. Only a radical change in human nature -
a decline in acquisitive and self-centred desires - could overcome the tendency for people to find a way around any system
43 

that suppresses private enterprise. Since no such change in human nature is in sight, we shall probably continue to pay most
to those with inherited abilities, rather than those who have
the greatest needs. To hope for something entirely different is
unrealistic. To work for wider recognition of the principle of
payment according to needs and effort rather than inherited
ability is both realistic and, I believe, right.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
The preceding section suggested that moving to a more egalitarian society in which differences of income are reduced is
ethically desirable but likely to prove difficult. Short of bringing
about general equality, we might at least attempt to ensure that
where there are important differences in income, status, and
power, women and racial minorities should not be on the worse
end in numbers disproportionate to their numbers in the community as a whole. Inequalities among members of the same
ethnic group may be no more justifiable than those between
ethnic groups, or between males and females, but when these
inequalities coincide with an obvious difference between people
like the differences between African Americans and Americans
of European descent, or between males and females, they do
more to produce a divided society with a sense of superiority
on the one side and a sense of inferiority on the other. Racial
and sexual inequality may therefore have a more divisive effect
than other forms of inequality. It may also do more to create a
feeling of hopelessness among the inferior group, since their sex
or their race is not the product of their own actions and there
is nothing they can do to change it.
How are racial and sexual equality to be achieved within an
inegalitarian society? We have seen that equality of opportunity
is practically unrealisable, and if it could be realised might allow
innate differences in aggression or IQ unfairly to determine
44 

membership of the upper strata. One way of overcoming these
obstacles is to go beyond equality of opportunity and give preferential treatment to members of disadvantaged groups. This is
affirmative action (sometimes also called 'reverse discrimination'). It may be the best hope of reducing long-standing inequalities; yet it appears to offend against the principle of
equality itself. Hence it is controversial.
Affirmative action is most often used in education and employment. Education is a particularly important area, since it
has an important influence on one's prospects of earning a high
income, holding a satisfying job, and achieving power and status
in the community. Moreover in the United States education has
been at the centre of the dispute over affirmative action because
of Supreme Court cases over university admission procedures
favouring disadvantaged groups. These cases have arisen because males of European descent were denied admission to
courses although their academic records and admission test
scores were better than those of some African American students
admitted. The universities did not deny this; they sought to
justify it by explaining that they operated admission schemes
intended to help disadvantaged students.
The leading case, as far as United States law is concerned, is
Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. Alan Bakke applied
for admission to the medical school of the University of California at Davis. In an attempt to increase the number of members
of minority groups who attended medical school, the university
reserved 16 out of every 100 places for students belonging to a
disadvantaged minority. Since these students would not have
w on SQjnany places in open competition, fewer students of
European descent were admitted than there would have been
without this reservation. Some of these students denied places
would certainly have been offered them if, scoring as they did
on the admission tests, they had been members of a disadvantaged minority. Bakke was among these rejected European
45 

American students and on being rejected he sued the university.
Let us take this case as a standard case of affirmative action. Is
it defensible?
I shall start by putting aside one argument sometimes used
to justify discrimination in favour of members of disadvantaged
groups. It is sometimes said that if, say, 20 per cent of the
population is a racial minority, and yet only 2 per cent of doctors
are from this minority, this is sufficient evidence that, somewhere along the line, our community discriminates on the basis
of race. (Similar arguments have been mounted in support of
claims of sexual discrimination.) Our discussion of the geneticsversus-environment debate indicates why this argument is inconclusive. It may be the case that members of the underrepresented group are, on average, less gifted for the kind of
study one must do to become a doctor. I am not saying that
this is true, or even probable, but it cannot be ruled out at this
stage. So a disproportionately small number of doctors from a
particular ethnic minority is not in itself proof of discrimination
against members of that minority. (Just as the disproportionately large number of African American athletes in the U.S.
Olympic athletic team is not in itself proof of discrimination
against European Americans.) There might, of course, be other
evidence suggesting that the small number of doctors from the
minority group really is the result of discrimination; but this
would need to be shown. In the absence of positive evidence
of discrimination, it is not possible to justify affirmative action
on the grounds that it merely redresses the balance of discrimination existing in the community.
Another way of defending a decision to accept a minority
student in preference to a student from the majority group who
scored higher in admission tests would be to argue that standard
tests do not give an accurate indication of ability when one
student has been severely disadvantaged. This is in line with
the point made in the last section about the impossibility of
achieving equal opportunity. Education and home background
46 

presumably influence test scores. A student with a background
of deprivation who scores 55 per cent in an admission test may
have better prospects of graduating in minimum time than a
more privileged student who scores 70 per cent. Adjusting test
scores on this basis would not mean admitting disadvantaged
minority students in preference to better-qualified students. It
would reflect a decision that the disadvantaged students really
were better qualified than the others. This is not racial discrimination.
The University of California could not attempt this defence,
for its medical school at Davis had simply reserved 16 per cent
of places for minority students. The quota did not vary according
to the ability displayed by minority applicants. This may be in
the interests of ultimate equality, but it is undeniably racial
discrimination.
In this chapter we have seen that the only defensible basis
for the claim that all humans are equal is the principle of equal
consideration of interests. That principle outlaws forms of racial
and sexual discrimination which give less weight to the interests
of those discriminated against. Could Bakke claim that in rejecting his application the medical school gave less weight to
his interests than to those of African American students?
We have only to ask this question to appreciate that university
admission is not normally a result of consideration of the interests of each applicant. It depends rather on matching the
applicants against standards that the university draws up with
certain policies in mind. Take the most straightforward case:
admission rigidly governed by scores on an intelligence test.
Suppose those rejected by this procedure complained that their
interests had been given less consideration than the interests of
applicants of higher intelligence. The university would reply that
its procedure did not take the applicants' interests into account
at all, and so could hardly give less consideration to the interests
of one applicant than it gave to others. We could then ask the
university why it used intelligence as the criterion of admission.
47 

It might say, first, that to pass the examinations required for
graduation takes a high level of intelligence. There is no point
in admitting students unable to pass, for they will not be able
to graduate. They will waste their own time and the university's
resources. Secondly, the university may say, the higher the intelligence of our graduates, the more useful they are likely to
be to the community. The more intelligent our doctors, the
better they will be at preventing and curing disease. Hence the
more intelligent the students a medical school selects, the better
value the community gets for its outlay on medical education.
This particular admission procedure is of course one-sided; a
good doctor must have other qualities in addition to a high
degree of intelligence. It is only an example, however, and that
objection is not relevant to the point I am using the example
to make. This point is that no one objects to intelligence as a
criterion for selection in the way that they object to race as a
criterion; yet those of higher intelligence admitted under an
intelligence-based scheme have no more of an intrinsic right to
admission than those admitted by reverse discrimination. Higher
intelligence, I have argued before, carries with it no right or
justifiable claim to more of the good things our society offers.
If a university admits students of higher intelligence it does so
not in consideration of their greater interest in being admitted,
nor in recognition of their right to be admitted, but because it
favours goals that it believes will be advanced by this admission
procedure. So if this same university should adopt new goals
and use affirmative action to promote them, applicants who
would have been admitted under the old procedure cannot
claim that the new procedure violates their right to be admitted,
or treats them with less respect than others. They had no special
claim to be admitted in the first place; they were the fortunate
beneficiaries of the old university policy. Now that this policy
has changed others benefit, not they. If this seems unfair, it is
only because we had become accustomed to the old policy.
So affirmative action cannot justifiably be condemned on the
48 

grounds that it violates the rights of university applicants, or
treats them with less than equal consideration. There is no inherent right to admission, and equal consideration of the interests of applicants is not involved in normal admission tests.
If affirmative action is open to objection it must be because the
goals it seeks to advance are bad, or because it will not really
promote these goals.
The principle of equality might be a ground for condemning
the goals of a racially discriminatory admissions procedure.
When universities discriminate against already disadvantaged
minorities we suspect that the discrimination really does result
from less concern for the interests of the minority. Why else did
universities in the American South excluded African Americans
until segregation was held to be unconstitutional? Here, in contrast to the affirmative action situation, those rejected could
justifiably claim that their interests were not being weighed
equally with the interests of European Americans who were
admitted. Other explanations may have been offered, but they
were surely specious.
Opponents of affirmative action have not objected to the goals
of social equality and greater minority representation in the
professions. They would be hard put to do so. Equal consideration of interests supports moves towards equality because of
the principle of diminishing marginal utility, because it relieves
the feeling of hopeless inferiority that can exist when members
of one race or sex are always worse off than members of another
race or the other sex, and because severe inequality between
races means a divided community with consequent racial
tension.
Within the overall goal of social equality, greater minority
representation in professions like law and medicine is desirable
for several reasons. Members of minority groups are more likely
to work among their own people than those who come from
the mainstream ethnic groups, and this may help to overcome
the scarcity of doctors and lawyers in poor neighbourhoods
49 

where most members of disadvantaged minorities live. They
may also have a better understanding of the problems disadvantaged people face than any outsider would have. Minority
and female doctors and lawyers can serve as role models to
other members of minority groups, and to women, breaking
down the unconscious mental barriers against aspiring to such
positions. Finally, the existence of a diverse student group will
help members of the dominant ethnic group to learn more about
the attitudes of African Americans and women, and thus become better able, as doctors and lawyers, to serve the whole
community.
Opponents of affirmative action are on stronger ground when
they claim that affirmative action will not promote equality. As
Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., said, in the Bakke case, 'Preferential
programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that
certain groups are unable to achieve success without special
protection.' To achieve real equality, it might be said, members
of minority groups and women must win their places on their
merits. As long as they get into law school more easily than
others, law graduates from disadvantaged minority groups -
including those who would have got in under open competition
- will be regarded as inferior.
There is also a long-term objection to affirmative action as a
means to equality. In the present social climate we may be
confident that race will be taken into account only to benefit
disadvantaged minorities; but will this climate last? Should old
-fashioned racism return, won't our approval of racial quotas
now make it easier to turn them against minority groups? Can
we really expect the introduction of racial distinctions to advance the goal of the elimination of racial distinctions?
These practical objections raise difficult factual issues. Though
they were referred to in the Bakke case, they have not been
central in the American legal battles over affirmative action.
Judges are properly reluctant to decide cases on factual grounds
on which they have no special expertise. Alan Bakke won his
50 

case chiefly on the grounds that the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964 provides that no person shall, on the grounds of colour,
race, or national origin, be excluded from any activity receiving
federal financial assistance. A bare majority of the judges held
that this excluded all discrimination, benign or not. They added,
however, that there would be no objection to a university including race as one among a number of factors, like athletic or
artistic ability, work experience, demonstrated compassion, a
history of overcoming disadvantage, or leadership potential. The
court thus effectively allowed universities to choose their student body in accord with their own goals, as long as they did
not use quotas.
That may be the law in the United States, but in other countries - and in general, when we look at the issue with an eye
to ethics, rather than the law - the distinction between quotas
and other ways of giving preference to disadvantaged groups
may be less significant. The important point is that affirmative
action, whether by quotas or some other method, is not contrary
to any sound principle of equality and does not violate any
rights of those excluded by it. Properly applied, it is in keeping
with equal consideration of interests, in its aspirations at least.
The only real doubt is whether it will work. In the absence of
more promising alternatives it seems worth a try.
A CONCLUDING NOTE: EQUALITY AND DISABILITY
In this chapter we have been concerned with the interplay of
the moral principle of equality and the differences, real or alleged, between groups of people. Perhaps the clearest way of
seeing the irrelevance of IQ, or specific abilities, to the moral
principle of equality, is to consider the situation of people with
disabilities, whether physical or intellectual. When we consider
how such people are to be treated, there is no argument about
whether they are as able as people without disabilities. By definition, they are lacking at least some ability that normal people
51 

have. These disabilities will sometimes mean that they should
be treated differently from others. When we are looking for firefighters, we can justifiably exclude someone who is confined to
a wheelchair; and if we are seeking a proof-reader, a blind
person need not apply. But the fact that a specific disability may
rule a person out of consideration for a particular position does
not mean that that person's interests should be given less consideration than those of anyone else. Nor does it justify discrimination against disabled people in any situation in which the
particular disability a person has is not relevant to the employment or service offered.
For centuries, disabled people have been subjected to prejudice, in some cases no less severe than those under which
racial minorities have suffered. Intellectually disabled people
were locked up, out of sight of the public, in appalling conditions. Some were virtual slaves, exploited for cheap labour in
households or factories. Under a so-called "euthanasia program" the Nazis murdered tens of thousands of intellectually
disabled people who were quite capable of wanting to continue
living and enjoying their lives. Even today, some businesses will
not hire a person in a wheelchair for a job that she could do as
well as anyone else. Others seeking a salesperson will not hire
someone whose appearance is abnormal, for fear that sales will
fall. (Similar arguments were used against employing members
of racial minorities; we can best overcome such prejudices by
becoming used to people who are different from us.)
We are now just starting to think about the injustice that has
been done to disabled people, and to consider them as a disadvantaged group. That we have been slow in doing so may
well be due to the confusion between factual equality and moral
equality discussed earlier in this chapter. Because disabled people are different, in some respects, we have not seen it as discriminatory to treat them differently. We have overlooked the
fact that, as in the examples given above, the disabled person's
disability has been irrelevant to the different - and disadvan52 

tageous - treatment. There is therefore a need to ensure that
legislation that prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, ethnicity or gender also prohibits discrimination on the grounds of
disability, unless the disability can be shown to be relevant to
the employment or service offered.
Nor is that all. Many of the arguments for affirmative action
in the case of those disadvantaged by race or gender apply even
more strongly to disabled people. Mere equality of opportunity
will not be enough in situations in which a disability makes it
impossible to become an equal member of the community. Giving disabled people equal opportunity to attend university is
not much use if the library is accessible only by a flight of stairs
that they cannot use. Many disabled children are capable of
benefitting from normal schooling, but are prevented from taking part because additional resources are required to cope with
their special needs. Since such needs are often very central to
the lives of disabled people, the principle of equal consideration
of interests will give them much greater weight than more minor
needs of others. For this reason, it will generally be justifiable
to spend more on behalf of disabled people than we spend on
behalf of others. Just how much more is, of course, a difficult
question. Where resources are scarce, there must be some limit.
By giving equal consideration to the interests of those with
disabilities, and empathetically imagining ourselves in their situation, we can, in principle, reach the right answer; but it will
not be easy to determine what exactly, in each particular situation, that answer should be.
Some will claim to find a contradiction between this recognition of disabled people as a group that has been subjected to
unjustifiable discrimination, and arguments that appear later in
this book defending abortion and infanticide in the case of a
fetus or an infant with a severe disability. For these later arguments presuppose that life is better without a disability than
with one; and is this not itself a form of prejudice, held by
people without disabilities, and parallel to the prejudice that it
53 

is better to be a member of the European race, or a man, than
to be of African descent, or a woman?
The error in this argument is not difficult to detect. It is one
thing to argue that people with disabilities who want to live
their lives to the full should be given every possible assistance
in doing so. It is another, and quite different thing, to argue
that if we are in a position to choose, for our next child, whether
that child shall begin life with or without a disability, it is mere
prejudice or bias that leads us to choose to have a child without
a disability. If disabled people who must use wheelchairs to get
around were suddenly offered a miracle drug that would, with
no side effects, give them full use of their legs, how many of
them would refuse to take it on the grounds that life with a
disability is in no way inferior to life without a disability? In
seeking medical assistance to overcome and eliminate disability,
when it is available, disabled people themselves show that the
preference for a life without disability is no mere prejudice.
Some disabled people might say that they make this choice only
because society puts so many obstacles in the way of disabled
people. They claim that it is social conditions that disable them,
not their physical or intellectual condition. This assertions twists
the more limited truth, that social conditions make the lives of
the disabled much more difficult than they need be, into a
sweeping falsehood. To be able to walk, to see, to hear, to be
relatively free from pain and discomfort, to communicate effectively - all these are, under virtually any social conditions,
genuine benefits. To say this is not to deny that people lacking
these abilities may triumph over their disabilities and have lives
of astonishing richness and diversity. Nevertheless, we show no
prejudice against disabled people if we prefer, whether for ourselves or for our children, not to be faced with hurdles so great
that to surmount them is in itself a triumph.

EQUALITY FOR ANIMALS?
RACISM AND SPECIESISM
I
N Chapter 2,1 gave reasons for believing that the fundamental
principle of equality, on which the equality of all human
beings rests, is the principle of equal consideration of interests.
Only a basic moral principle of this kind can allow us to defend
a form of equality that embraces all human beings, with all the
differences that exist between them. I shall now contend that
while this principle does provide an adequate basis for human
equality, it provides a basis that cannot be limited to humans.
In other words I shall suggest that, having accepted the principle
of equality as a sound moral basis for relations with others of
our own species, we are also committed to accepting it as a
sound moral basis for relations with those outside our own
species - the non-human animals.
This suggestion may at first seem bizarre. We are used to
regarding discrimination against members of racial minorities,
or against women, as among the most important moral and
political issues facing the world today. These are serious matters,
worthy of the time and energy of any concerned person. But
animals? Isn't the welfare of animals in a different category
altogether, a matter for people who are dotty about dogs and
cats? How can anyone waste their time on equality for animals
when so many humans are denied real equality?
This attitude reflects a popular prejudice against taking the
interests of animals seriously - a prejudice no better founded
than the prejudice of white slaveowners against taking the in55 

terests of their African slaves seriously. It is easy for us to criticise
the prejudices of our grandfathers, from which our fathers freed
themselves. It is more difficult to distance ourselves from our
own views, so that we can dispassionately search for prejudices
among the beliefs and values we hold. What is needed now is
a willingness to follow the arguments where they lead, without
a prior assumption that the issue is not worth our attention.
The argument for extending the principle of equality beyond
our own species is simple, so simple that it amounts to no more
than a clear understanding of the nature of the principle of equal
consideration of interests. We have seen that this principle implies that our concern for others ought not to depend on what
they are like, or what abilities they possess (although precisely
what this concern requires us to do may vary according to the
characteristics of those affected by what we do). It is on this
basis that we are able to say that the fact that some people are
not members of our race does not entitle us to exploit them,
and similarly the fact that some people are less intelligent than
others does not mean that their interests may be disregarded.
But the principle also implies that the fact that beings are not
members of our species does not entitle us to exploit them, and
similarly the fact that other animals are less intelligent than we
are does not mean that their interests may be disregarded.
We saw in Chapter 2 that many philosophers have advocated
equal consideration of interests, in some form or other, as a
basic moral principle. Only a few have recognised that the principle has applications beyond our own species, one of the few
being Jeremy Bentham, the founding father of modern utilitarianism. In a forward-looking passage, written at a time when
African slaves in the British dominions were still being treated
much as we now treat nonhuman animals, Bentham wrote:
The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may
acquire those rights which never could have been withholden
from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already
discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a
56 
?
human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice
of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognised that the
number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination
of the os sacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning
a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should
trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps
the faculty of discourse? But a fullgrown horse or dog is beyond
comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old.
But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail? The
question is not. Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but, Can
they suffer?
In this passage Bentham points to the capacity for suffering as
the vital characteristic that entitles a being to equal consideration. The capacity for suffering - or more strictly, for suffering
and/or enjoyment or happiness - is not just another characteristic like the capacity for language, or for higher mathematics.
Bentham is not saying that those who try to mark 'the insuperable line' that determines whether the interests of a being
should be considered happen to have selected the wrong characteristic. The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a
prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be
satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful
way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests
of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone
does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that
we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare.
A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being
tormented, because mice will suffer if they are treated in this
way.
If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what
the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that
the suffering be counted equally with the like suffering - in so
far as rough comparisons can be made - of any other being. If
a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment
57 

or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is
why the limit of sentience (using the term as a convenient, if
not strictly accurate, shorthand for the capacity to suffer or
experience enjoyment or happiness) is the only defensible
boundary of concern for the interests of others. To mark this
boundary by some characteristic like intelligence or rationality
would be to mark it in an arbitrary way. Why not choose some
other characteristic, like skin colour?
Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater
weight to the interests of members of their own race when there
is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of
another race. Racists of European descent typically have not
accepted that pain matters as much when it is felt by Africans,
for example, as when it is felt by Europeans. Similarly those I
would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to the interests of
members of their own species when there is a clash between
their interests and the interests of those of other species. Human
speciesists do not accept that pain is as bad when it is felt by
pigs or mice as when it is felt by humans.
That, then, is really the whole of the argument for extending
the principle of equality to nonhuman animals; but there may
be some doubts about what this equality amounts to in practice.
In particular, the last sentence of the previous paragraph may
prompt some people to reply: 'Surely pain felt by a mouse just
is not as bad as pain felt by a human. Humans have much
greater awareness of what is happening to them, and this makes
their suffering worse. You can't equate the suffering of, say, a
person dying slowly from cancer, and a laboratory mouse undergoing the same fate.'
I fully accept that in the case described the human cancer
victim normally suffers more than the nonhuman cancer victim.
This in no way undermines the extension of equal consideration
of interests to nonhumans. It means, rather, that we must take
care when we compare the interests of different species. In some
situations a member of one species will suffer more than a
58 
?
member of another species. In this case we should still apply
the principle of equal consideration of interests but the result
of so doing is, of course, to give priority to relieving the greater
suffering. A simpler case may help to make this clear.
If I give a horse a hard slap across its rump with my open
hand, the horse may start, but it presumably feels little pain. Its
skin is thick enough to protect it against a mere slap. If I slap
a baby in the same way, however, the baby will cry and presumably does feel pain, for the baby's skin is more sensitive. So
it is worse to slap a baby than a horse, if both slaps are administered with equal force. But there must be some kind of blow
- I don't know exactly what it would be, but perhaps a blow
with a heavy stick - that would cause the horse as much pain
as we cause a baby by a simple slap. That is what I mean by
'the same amount of pain' and if we consider it wrong to inflict
that much pain on a baby for no good reason then we must,
unless we are speciesists, consider it equally wrong to inflict the
same amount of pain on a horse for no good reason.
There are other differences between humans and animals that
cause other complications. Normal adult human beings have
mental capacities that will, in certain circumstances, lead them
to suffer more than animals would in the same circumstances.
If, for instance, we decided to perform extremely painful or
lethal scientific experiments on normal adult humans, kidnapped at random from public parks for this purpose, adults
w ho entered parks would become fearful that they would be
kidnapped. The resultant terror would be a form of suffering
additional to the pain of the experiment. The same experiments
performed on nonhuman animals would cause less suffering
since the animals would not have the anticipatory dread of being
kidnapped and experimented upon. This does not mean, of
course, that it would be right to perform the experiment on
animals, but only that there is a reason, and one that is not
speciesist, for preferring to use animals rather than normal adult
humans, if the experiment is to be done at all. Note, however,
59 

that this same argument gives us a reason for preferring to use
human infants - orphans perhaps - or severely intellectually
disabled humans for experiments, rather than adults, since infants and severely intellectually disabled humans would also
have no idea of what was going to happen to them. As far as
this argument is concerned, nonhuman animals and infants and
severely intellectually disabled humans are in the same category; and if we use this argument to justify experiments on
nonhuman animals we have to ask ourselves whether we are
also prepared to allow experiments on human infants and severely intellectually disabled adults. If we make a distinction
between animals and these humans, how can we do it, other
than on the basis of a morally indefensible preference for members of our own species?
There are many areas in which the superior mental powers
of normal adult humans make a difference: anticipation, more
detailed memory, greater knowledge of what is happening, and
so on. These differences explain why a human dying from cancer
is likely to suffer more than a mouse. It is the mental anguish
that makes the human's position so much harder to bear. Yet
these differences do not all point to greater suffering on the part
of the normal human being. Sometimes animals may suffer
more because of their more limited understanding. If, for instance, we are taking prisoners in wartime we can explain to
them that while they must submit to capture, search, and confinement they will not otherwise be harmed and will be set free
at the conclusion of hostilities. If we capture wild animals, however, we cannot explain that we are not threatening their lives.
A wild animal cannot distinguish an attempt to overpower and
confine from an attempt to kill; the one causes as much terror
as the other.
It may be objected that comparisons of the sufferings of different species are impossible to make, and that for this reason
when the interests of animals and humans clash, the principle
of equality gives no guidance. It is true that comparisons of
60 
?
suffering between members of different species cannot be made
precisely. Nor, for that matter, can comparisons of suffering
between different human beings be made precisely. Precision is
not essential. As we shall see shortly, even if we were to prevent
the infliction of suffering on animals only when the interests of
humans will not be affected to anything like the extent that
animals are affected, we would be forced to make radical
changes in our treatment of animals that would involve our
diet, the farming methods we use, experimental procedures in
many fields of science, our approach to wildlife and to hunting,
trapping and the wearing of furs, and areas of entertainment
like circuses, rodeos, and zoos. As a result, the total quantity of
suffering caused would be greatly reduced; so greatly that it is
hard to imagine any other change of moral attitude that would
cause so great a reduction in the total sum of suffering in the
universe.
So far I have said a lot about the infliction of suffering on
animals, but nothing about killing them. This omission has been
deliberate. The application of the principle of equality to the
infliction of suffering is, in theory at least, fairly straightforward.
Pain and suffering are bad and should be prevented or minimised, irrespective of the race, sex, or species of the being that
suffers. How bad a pain is depends on how intense it is and
how long it lasts, but pains of the same intensity and duration
are equally bad, whether felt by humans or animals. When we
come to consider the value of life, we cannot say quite so confidently that a life is a life, and equally valuable, whether it is
a human life or an animal life. It would not be speciesist to hold
that the life of a self-aware being, capable of abstract thought,
of planning for the future, of complex acts of communication,
and so on, is more valuable than the life of a being without
these capacities. (I am not saying whether this view is justifiable
or not; only that it cannot simply be rejected as speciesist, because it is not on the basis of species itself that one life is held
61 

to be more valuable than another.) The value of life is a notoriously difficult ethical question, and we can only arrive at a
reasoned conclusion about the comparative value of human and
animal life after we have discussed the value of life in general.
This is a topic for a separate chapter. Meanwhile there are important conclusions to be derived from the extension beyond
our own species of the principle of equal consideration of interests, irrespective of our conclusions about the value of life.
SPECIESISM IN PRACTICE
Animals as Food
For most people in modern, urbanised societies, the principal
form of contact with nonhuman animals is at meal times. The
use of animals for food is probably the oldest and the most
widespread form of animal use. There is also a sense in which
it is the most basic form of animal use, the foundation stone on
which rests the belief that animals exist for our pleasure and
convenience.
If animals count in their own right, our use of animals for
food becomes questionable - especially when animal flesh is a
luxury rather than a necessity. Eskimos living in an environment
where they must kill animals for food or starve might be justified
in claiming that their interest in surviving overrides that of the
animals they kill. Most of us cannot defend our diet in this way.
Citizens of industrialised societies can easily obtain an adequate
diet without the use of animal flesh. The overwhelming weight
of medical evidence indicates that animal flesh is not necessary
for good health or longevity. Nor is animal production in industrialised societies an efficient way of producing food, since
most of the animals consumed have been fattened on grains
and other foods that we could have eaten directly. When we
feed these grains to animals, only about 10 per cent of the
nutritional value remains as meat for human consumption. So,
62 
?
with the exception of animals raised entirely on grazing land
unsuitable for crops, animals are eaten neither for health, nor
to increase our food supply. Their flesh is a luxury, consumed
because people like its taste.
In considering the ethics of the use of animal flesh for human
food in industrialised societies, we are considering a situation
in which a relatively minor human interest must be balanced
against the lives and welfare of the animals involved. The principle of equal consideration of interests does not allow major
interests to be sacrificed for minor interests.
The case against using animals for food is at its strongest when
animals are made to lead miserable lives so that their flesh can
be made available to humans at the lowest possible cost. Modern
forms of intensive farming apply science and technology to the
attitude that animals are objects for us to use. In order to have
meat on the table at a price that people can afford, our society
tolerates methods of meat production that confine sentient animals in cramped, unsuitable conditions for the entire duration
of their lives. Animals are treated like machines that convert
fodder into flesh, and any innovation that results in a higher
'conversion ratio' is liable to be adopted. As one authority on
the subject has said, 'Cruelty is acknowledged only when profitability ceases.' To avoid speciesism we must stop these practices. Our custom is all the support that factory farmers need.
The decision to cease giving them that support may be difficult,
but it is less difficult than it would have been for a white Southerner to go against the traditions of his society and free his slaves;
if we do not change our dietary habits, how can we censure
those slaveholders who would not change their own way of
living?
These arguments apply to animals who have been reared in
factory farms - which means that we should not eat chicken,
pork, or veal, unless we know that the meat we are eating was
not produced by factory farm methods. The same is true of beef
that has come from cattle kept in crowded feedlots (as most
63 

beef does in the United States). Eggs will come from hens kept
in small wire cages, too small even to allow them to stretch
their wings, unless the eggs are specifically sold as 'free range'
(or unless one lives in a relatively enlightened country like
Switzerland, which has prohibited the cage system of keeping
hens).
These arguments do not take us all the way to a vegetarian
diet, since some animals, for instance sheep, and in some countries cattle, still graze freely outdoors. This could change. The
American pattern of fattening cattle in crowded feedlots is
spreading to other countries. Meanwhile, the lives of free-ranging animals are undoubtedly better than those of animals reared
in factory farms. It is still doubtful if using them for food is
compatible with equal consideration of interests. One problem
is, of course, that using them as food involves killing them -
but this is an issue to which, as I have said, we shall return
when we have discussed the value of life in the next chapter.
Apart from taking their lives there are also many other things
done to animals in order to bring them cheaply to our dinner
table. Castration, the separation of mother and young, the
breaking up of herds, branding, transporting, and finally the
moments of slaughter - all of these are likely to involve suffering
and do not take the animals' interests into account. Perhaps
animals could be reared on a small scale without suffering in
these ways, but it does not seem economical or practical to do
so on the scale required for feeding our large urban populations.
In any case, the important question is not whether animal flesh
could be produced without suffering, but whether the flesh we
are considering buying was produced without suffering. Unless
we can be confident that it was, the principle of equal consideration of interests implies that it was wrong to sacrifice important interests of the animal in order to satisfy less important
interests of our own; consequently we should boycott the end
result of this process.
For those of us living in cities where it is difficult to know
64 
?
how the animals we might eat have lived and died, this conclusion brings us close to a vegetarian way of life. I shall consider
some objections to it in the final section of this chapter.
Experimenting on Animals
Perhaps the area in which speciesism can most clearly be observed is the use of animals in experiments. Here the issue stands
out starkly, because experimenters often seek to justify experimenting on animals by claiming that the experiments lead us
to discoveries about humans; if this is so, the experimenter must
agree that human and nonhuman animals are similar in crucial
respects. For instance, if forcing a rat to choose between starving
to death and crossing an electrified grid to obtain food tells us
anything about the reactions of humans to stress, we must assume that the rat feels stress in this kind of situation.
People sometimes think that all animal experiments serve
vital medical purposes, and can be justified on the grounds that
they relieve more suffering than they cause. This comfortable
belief is mistaken. Drug companies test new shampoos and cosmetics they are intending to market by dripping concentrated
solutions of them into the eyes of rabbits, in a test known as
the Draize test. (Pressure from the animal liberation movement
has led several cosmetic companies to abandon this practice.
An alternative test, not using animal, has now been found.
Nevertheless, many companies, including some of the largest,
still continue to perform the Draize test.) Food additives, including artificial colourings and preservatives, are tested by what
is known as the LD50 - a test designed to find the 'lethal dose',
or level of consumption that will make 50 per cent of a sample
of animals die. In the process nearly all of the animals are made
very sick before some finally die and others pull through. These
tests are not necessary to prevent human suffering: even if there
were no alternative to the use of animals to test the safety of
the products, we already have enough shampoos and food col65 

ourings. There is no need to develop new ones that might be
dangerous.
In many countries, the armed forces perform atrocious experiments on animals that rarely come to light. To give just one
example: at the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Institute, in
Bethesda, Maryland, rhesus monkeys have been trained to run
inside a large wheel. If they slow down too much, the wheel
slows down, too, and the monkeys get an electric shock. Once
the monkeys are trained to run for long periods, they are given
lethal doses of radiation. Then, while sick and vomiting, they
are forced to continue to run until they drop. This is supposed
to provide information on the capacities of soldiers to continue
to fight after a nuclear attack.
Nor can all university experiments be defended on the
grounds that they relieve more suffering than they inflict. Three
experimenters at Princeton University kept 256 young rats without food or water until they died. They concluded that young
rats under conditions of fatal thirst and starvation are much
more active than normal adult rats given food and water. In a
well-known series of experiments that went on for more than
fifteen years, H. F. Harlow of the Primate Research Center, Madison, Wisconsin, reared monkeys under conditions of maternal
deprivation and total isolation. He found that in this way he
could reduce the monkeys to a state in which, when placed
among normal monkeys, they sat huddled in a corner in a
condition of persistent depression and fear. Harlow also produced monkey mothers so neurotic that they smashed their
infant's face into the floor and rubbed it back and forth. Although Harlow himself is no longer alive, some of his former
students at other U.S. universities continue to perform variations
on his experiments.
In these cases, and many others like them, the benefits to
humans are either nonexistent or uncertain, while the losses to
members of other species are certain and real. Hence the ex66 
?
periments indicate a failure to give equal consideration to the
interests of all beings, irrespective of species.
In the past, argument about animal experimentation has often
missed this point because it has been put in absolutist terms:
would the opponent of experimentation be prepared to let thousands die from a terrible disease that could be cured by experimenting on one animal? This is a purely hypothetical question,
since experiments do not have such dramatic results, but as long
as its hypothetical nature is clear, I think the question should
be answered affirmatively - in other words, if one, or even a
dozen animals had to suffer experiments in order to save thousands, I would think it right and in accordance with equal
consideration of interests that they should do so. This, at any
rate, is the answer a utilitarian must give. Those who believe
in absolute rights might hold that it is always wrong to sacrifice
one being, whether human or animal, for the benefit of another.
In that case the experiment should not be carried out, whatever
the consequences.
To the hypothetical question about saving thousands of people through a single experiment on an animal, opponents of
speciesism can reply with a hypothetical question of their own:
would experimenters be prepared to perform their experiments
on orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage
if that were the only way to save thousands? (I say 'orphaned'
in order to avoid the complication of the feelings of the human
parents.) If experimenters are not prepared to use orphaned
humans with severe and irreversible brain damage, their readiness to use nonhuman animals seems to discriminate on the
basis of species alone, since apes, monkeys, dogs, cats, and even
mice and rats are more intelligent, more aware of what is happening to them, more sensitive to pain, and so on, than many
severely braindamaged humans barely surviving in hospital
wards and other institutions. There seems to be no morally
relevant characteristic that such humans have that nonhuman
67 

animals lack. Experimenters, then, show bias in favour of their
own species whenever they carry out experiments on nonhuman animals for purposes that they would not think justified
them in using human beings at an equal or lower level of sentience, awareness, sensitivity, and so on. If this bias were eliminated, the number of experiments performed on animals would
be greatly reduced.
Other Forms of Speciesism
I have concentrated on the use of animals as food and in research, since these are examples of large-scale, systematic speciesism. They are not, of course, the only areas in which the
principle of equal consideration of interests, extended beyond
the human species, has practical implications. There are many
other areas that raise similar issues, including the fur trade,
hunting in all its different forms, circuses, rodeos, zoos, and the
pet business. Since the philosophical questions raised by these
issues are not very different from those raised by the use of
animals as food and in research, I shall leave it to the reader to
apply the appropriate ethical principles to them.
SOME OBJECTIONS
I first put forward the views outlined in this chapter in 1973.
At that time there was no animal liberation or animal rights
movement. Since then a movement has sprung up, and some
of the worst abuses of animals, like the Draize and LD50 tests,
are now less widespread, even though they have not been eliminated. The fur trade has come under attack, and as a result fur
sales have declined dramatically in countries like Britain, the
Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. Some countries
are also starting to phase out the most confining forms of factory
farming. As already mentioned, Switzerland has prohibited the
cage system of keeping laying hens. Britain has outlawed the
68 
?
raising of calves in individual stalls, and is phasing out individual
stalls for pigs. Sweden, as in other areas of social reform, is in
the lead here, too: in 1988 the Swedish Parliament passed a
law that will, over a ten-year period, lead to the elimination of
all systems of factory farming that confine animals for long
periods and prevent them carrying out their natural behaviour.
Despite this increasing acceptance of many aspects of the case
for animal liberation, and the slow but tangible progress made
on behalf of animals, a variety of objections have emerged, some
straightforward and predictable, some more subtle and unexpected. In this final section of the chapter I shall attempt to
answer the most important of these objections. I shall begin
with the more straightforward ones.
How Do We Know That Animals Can Feel Pain?
We can never directly experience the pain of another being,
whether that being is human or not. When I see my daughter
fall and scrape her knee, I know that she feels pain because of
the way she behaves - she cries, she tells me her knee hurts,
she rubs the sore spot, and so on. I know that I myself behave
in a somewhat similar - if more inhibited - way when I feel
pain, and so I accept that my daughter feels something like what
I feel when I scrape my knee.
The basis of my belief that animals can feel pain is similar to
the basis of my belief that my daughter can feel pain. Animals
in pain behave in much the same way as humans do, and their
behaviour is sufficient justification for the belief that they feel
pain. It is true that, with the exception of those apes who have
been taught to communicate by sign language, they cannot
actually say that they are feeling pain - but then when my
daughter was very young she could not talk, either. She found
other ways to make her inner states apparent, thereby demonstrating that we can be sure that a being is feeling pain even
if the being cannot use language.
69 

To back up our inference from animal behaviour, we can
point to the fact that the nervous systems of all vertebrates, and
especially of birds and mammals, are fundamentally similar.
Those parts of the human nervous system that are concerned
with feeling pain are relatively old, in evolutionary terms. Unlike
the cerebral cortex, which developed fully only after our ancestors diverged from other mammals, the basic nervous system
evolved in more distant ancestors common to ourselves and the
other 'higher' animals. This anatomical parallel makes it likely
that the capacity of animals to feel is similar to our own.
It is significant that none of the grounds we have for believing
that animals feel pain hold for plants. We cannot observe behaviour suggesting pain - sensational claims to the contrary
have not been substantiated - and plants do not have a centrally
organised nervous system like ours.
Animals Eat Each Other, So Why Shouldn't We
Eat Them?
This might be called the Benjamin Franklin Objection. Franklin
recounts in his Autobiography that he was for a time a vegetarian
but his abstinence from animal flesh came to an end when he
was watching some friends prepare to fry a fish they had just
caught. When the fish was cut open, it was found to have a
smaller fish in its stomach. 'Well', Franklin said to himself, 'if
you eat one another, I don't see why we may not eat you' and
he proceeded to do so.
Franklin was at least honest. In telling this story, he confesses
that he convinced himself of the validity of the objection only
after the fish was already in the frying pan and smelling 'admirably well'; and he remarks that one of the advantages of
being a 'reasonable creature' is that one can find a reason for
whatever one wants to do. The replies that can be made to this
objection are so obvious that Franklin's acceptance of it does
testify more to his love of fried fish than to his powers of reason.
70 
?
For a start, most animals who kill for food would not be able
to survive if they did not, whereas we have no need to eat
animal flesh. Next, it is odd that humans, who normally think
of the behaviour of animals as 'beastly' should, when it suits
them, use an argument that implies that we ought to look to
animals for moral guidance. The most decisive point, however,
is that nonhuman animals are not capable of considering the
alternatives open to them or of reflecting on the ethics of their
diet. Hence it is impossible to hold the animals responsible for
what they do, or to judge that because of their killing they
'deserve' to be treated in a similar way. Those who read these
lines, on the other hand, must consider the justifiability of their
dietary habits. You cannot evade responsibility by imitating
beings who are incapable of making this choice.
Sometimes people point to the fact that animals eat each other
in order to make a slightly different point. This fact suggests,
they think, not that animals deserve to be eaten, but rather that
there is a natural law according to which the stronger prey upon
the weaker, a kind of Darwinian 'survival of the fittest' in which
by eating animals we are merely playing our part.
This interpretation of the objection makes two basic mistakes,
one a mistake of fact and the other an error of reasoning. The
factual mistake lies in the assumption that our own consumption of animals is part of the natural evolutionary process. This
might be true of a few primitive cultures that still hunt for food,
but it has nothing to do with the mass production of domestic
animals in factory farms.
Suppose that we did hunt for our food, though, and this was
part of some natural evolutionary process. There would still be
an error of reasoning in the assumption that because this process
is natural it is right. It is, no doubt, 'natural' for women to
produce an infant every year or two from puberty to menopause,
but this does not mean that it is wrong to interfere with this
process. We need to know the natural laws that affect us in
order to estimate the consequences of what we do; but we do
71 

not have to assume that the natural way of doing something is
incapable of improvement.
Differences between Humans and Animals
That there is a huge gulf between humans and animals was
unquestioned for most of the course of Western civilisation. The
basis of this assumption has been undermined by Darwin's discovery of our animal origins and the associated decline in the
credibility of the story of our Divine Creation, made in the image
of God with an immortal soul. Some have found it difficult to
accept that the differences between us and the other animals
are differences of degree rather than kind. They have searched
for ways of drawing a line between humans and animals. To
date these boundaries have been shortlived. For instance, it used
to be said that only humans used tools. Then it was observed
that the Galapagos woodpecker used a cactus thorn to dig insects
out of crevices in trees. Next it was suggested that even if other
animals used tools, humans are the only toolmaking animals.
But Jane Goodall found that chimpanzees in the jungles of
Tanzania chewed up leaves to make a sponge for sopping up
water, and trimmed the leaves off branches to make tools for
catching insects. The use of language was another boundary
line - but now chimpanzees, gorillas, and an orangutan have
learnt Ameslan, the sign language of the deaf, and there is some
evidence suggesting that whales and dolphins may have a complex language of their own.
If these attempts to draw the line between humans and animals had fitted the facts of the situation, they would still not
carry any moral weight. As Bentham pointed out, the fact that
a being does not use language or make tools is hardly a reason
for ignoring its suffering. Some philosophers have claimed that
there is a more profound difference. They have claimed that
animals cannot think or reason, and that accordingly they have
72 
?
no conception of themselves, no self-consciousness. They live
from instant to instant, and do not see themselves as distinct
entities with a past and a future. Nor do they have autonomy,
the ability to choose how to live one's life. It has been suggested
that autonomous, self-conscious beings are in some way much
more valuable, more morally significant, than beings who live
from moment to moment, without the capacity to see themselves as distinct beings with a past and a future. Accordingly,
on this view, the interests of autonomous, self-conscious beings
ought normally to take priority over the interests of other beings.
I shall not now consider whether some nonhuman animals
are self-conscious and autonomous. The reason for this omission
is that I do not believe that, in the present context, much depends on this question. We are now considering only the application of the principle of equal consideration of interests. In
the next chapter, when we discuss questions about the value
of life, we shall see that there are reasons for holding that selfconsciousness is crucial in debates about whether a being has
a right to life; and we shall then investigate the evidence for
self-consciousness in nonhuman animals. Meanwhile the more
important issue is: does the fact that a being is self-conscious
entitle that being to some kind of priority of consideration?
The claim that self-conscious beings are entitled to prior consideration is compatible with the principle of equal consideration of interests if it amounts to no more than the claim that
something that happens to self-conscious beings can be contrary
to their interests while similar events would not be contrary to
the interests of beings who were not self-conscious. This might
be because the self-conscious creature has greater awareness of
what is happening, can fit the event into the overall framework
of a longer time period, has different desires, and so on. But
this is a point I granted at the start of this chapter, and provided
that it is not carried to ludicrous extremes - like insisting that
if I am self-conscious and a veal calf is not, depriving me of veal
73 

causes more suffering than depriving the calf of his freedom to
walk, stretch and eat grass - it is not denied by the criticisms I
made of animal experimentation and factory farming.
It would be a different matter if it were claimed that, even
when a self-conscious being did not suffer more than a being
that was merely sentient, the suffering of the self-conscious
being is more important because these are more valuable types
of being. This introduces nonutilitarian claims of value - claims
that do not derive simply from taking a universal standpoint in
the manner described in the final section of Chapter 1. Since
the argument for utilitarianism developed in that section was
admittedly tentative, I cannot use that argument to rule out all
nonutilitarian values. Nevertheless we are entitled to ask why
self-conscious beings should be considered more valuable and
in particular why the alleged greater value of a self-conscious
being should result in preferring the lesser interests of a selfconscious being to the greater interests of a merely sentient
being, even where the self-consciousness of the former being is
not itself at stake. This last point is an important one, for we
are not now considering cases in which the lives of self-conscious beings are at risk but cases in which self-conscious beings
will go on living, their faculties intact, whatever we decide. In
these cases, if the existence of self-consciousness does not affect
the nature of the interests under comparison, it is not clear why
we should drag self-consciousness into the discussion at all, any
more than we should drag species, race or sex into similar discussions. Interests are interests, and ought to be given equal
consideration whether they are the interests of human or nonhuman animals, self-conscious or non-self-conscious animals.
There is another possible reply to the claim that selfconsciousness, or autonomy, or some similar characteristic, can
serve to distinguish human from nonhuman animals: recall that
there are intellectually disabled humans who have less claim to
be regarded as self-conscious or autonomous than many nonhuman animals. If we use these characteristics to place a gulf
74
J 
?
between humans and other animals, we place these less able
humans on the other side of the gulf; and if the gulf is taken
to mark a difference in moral status, then these humans would
have the moral status of animals rather than humans.
This reply is forceful, because most of us find horrifying the
idea of using intellectually disabled humans in painful experiments, or fattening them for gourmet dinners. But some philosophers have argued that these consequences would not really
follow from the use of a characteristic like self-consciousness or
autonomy to distinguish humans from other animals. I shall
consider three of these attempts.
The first suggestion is that severely intellectually disabled humans who do not possess the capacities that mark the normal
human off from other animals should nevertheless be treated
as if they did possess these capacities, since they belong to a
species, members of which normally do possess them. The suggestion is, in other words, that we treat individuals not in accordance with their actual qualities, but in accordance with the
qualities normal for their species.
It is interesting that this suggestion should be made in defence
of treating members of our species better than members of another species, when it would be firmly rejected if it were used
to justify treating members of our race or sex better than members of another race or sex. In the previous chapter, when discussing the impact of possible differences in IQ between
members of different ethnic groups, I made the obvious point
that whatever the difference between the average scores for different groups, some members of the group with the lower average score will do better than some members of groups with
the higher average score, and so we ought to treat people as
individuals and not according to the average score for their
ethnic group, whatever the explanation of that average might
be. If we accept this we cannot consistently accept the suggestion
that when dealing with severely intellectually disabled humans
we should grant them the status or rights normal for their spe75 

cies. For what is the significance of the fact that this time the
line is to be drawn around the species rather than around the
race or sex? We cannot insist that beings be treated as individuals in the one case, and as members of a group in the other.
Membership of a species is no more relevant in these circumstances than membership of a race or sex.
A second suggestion is that although severely intellectually
disabled humans may not possess higher capacities than other
animals, they are nonetheless human beings, and as such we
have special relations with them that we do not have with other
animals. As one reviewer of Animal Liberation put it: 'Partiality
for our own species, and within it for much smaller groupings
is, like the universe, something we had better accept . . . The
danger in an attempt to eliminate partial affections is that it
may remove the source of all affections.'
This argument ties morality too closely to our affections. Of
course some people may have a closer relationship with the
most profoundly intellectually disabled human than they do
with any nonhuman animal, and it would be absurd to tell
them that they should not feel this way. They simply do, and
as such there is nothing good or bad about it. The question is
whether our moral obligations to a being should be made to
depend on our feelings in this manner. Notoriously, some human beings have a closer relationship with their cat than with
their neighbours. Would those who tie morality to affections
accept that these people are justified in saving their cats from
a fire before they save their neighbours? And even those who
are prepared to answer this question affirmatively would, I trust,
not want to go along with racists who could argue that if people
have more natural relationships with, and greater affection towards, others of their own race, it is all right for them to give
preference to the interests of other members of their own race.
Ethics does not demand that we eliminate personal relationships
and partial affections, but it does demand that when we act we
76 
?
assess the moral claims of those affected by our actions with
some degree of independence from our feelings for them.
The third suggestion invokes the widely used 'slippery slope'
argument. The idea of this argument is that once we take one
step in a certain direction we shall find ourselves on a slippery
slope and shall slither further than we wished to go. In the
present context the argument is used to suggest that we need
a clear line to divide those beings we can experiment upon,
or fatten for dinner, from those we cannot. Species membership makes a nice sharp dividing line, whereas levels of selfconsciousness, autonomy, or sentience do not. Once we allow
that an intellectually disabled human being has no higher moral
status than an animal, the argument goes, we have begun our
descent down a slope, the next level of which is denying rights
to social misfits, and the bottom of which is a totalitarian government disposing of any groups it does not like by classifying
them as subhuman.
The slippery slope argument may serve as a valuable warning
in some contexts, but it cannot bear too much weight. If we
believe that, as I have argued in this chapter, the special status
we now give to humans allows us to ignore the interests of
billions of sentient creatures, we should not be deterred from
trying to rectify this situation by the mere possibility that the
principles on which we base this attempt will be misused by
evil rulers for their own ends. And it is no more than a possibility. The change I have suggested might make no difference
to our treatment of humans, or it might even improve it.
In the end, no ethical line that is arbitrarily drawn can be
secure. It is better to find a line that can be defended openly
and honestly. When discussing euthanasia in Chapter 7 we shall
see that a line drawn in the wrong place can have unfortunate
results even for those placed on the higher, or human side of
the line.
It is also important to remember that the aim of my argument
77 

is to elevate the status of animals rather than to lower the status
of any humans. I do not wish to suggest that intellectually
disabled humans should be force-fed with food colourings until
half of them die - although this would certainly give us a more
accurate indication of whether the substance was safe for humans than testing it on rabbits or dogs does. I would like our
conviction that it would be wrong to treat intellectually disabled
humans in this way to be transferred to nonhuman animals at
similar levels of self-consciousness and with similar capacities
for suffering. It is excessively pessimistic to refrain from trying
to alter our attitudes on the grounds that we might start treating
intellectually disabled humans with the same lack of concern
we now have for animals, rather than give animals the greater
concern that we now have for intellectually disabled humans.
Ethics and Reciprocity
In the earliest surviving major work of moral philosophy in the
Western tradition, Plato's Republic, there is to be found the following view of ethics:
They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,
evil; but that there is more evil in the latter than good in the
former. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice
and have had experience of both, any who are not able to avoid
the one and obtain the other, think that they had better agree
among themselves to have neither; hence they begin to establish
laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law
is termed by them lawful and just. This, it is claimed, is the origin
and nature of justice - it is a mean or compromise, between the
best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the
worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of
retaliation.
This was not Plato's own view; he put it into the mouth of
Glaucon in order to allow Socrates, the hero of his dialogue, to
refute it. It is a view that has never gained general acceptance,
but has not died away either. Echoes of it can be found in the
78 
?
ethical theories of contemporary philosophers like John Rawls
and David Gauthier; and it has been used, by these philosophers
and others, to justify the exclusion of animals from the sphere
of ethics, or at least from its core. For if the basis of ethics is
that I refrain from doing nasty things to others as long as they
don't do nasty things to me, I have no reason against doing
nasty things to those who are incapable of appreciating my
restraint and controlling their conduct towards me accordingly.
Animals, by and large, are in this category. When I am surfing
far out from shore and a shark attacks, my concern for animals
will not help; I am as likely to be eaten as the next surfer,
though he may spend every Sunday afternoon taking potshots
at sharks from a boat. Since animals cannot reciprocate, they
are, on this view, outside the limits of the ethical contract.
In assessing this conception of ethics we should distinguish
between explanations of the origin of ethical judgments, and
justifications of these judgments. The explanation of the origin
of ethics in terms of a tacit contract between people for their
mutual benefit has a certain plausibility (though in view of the
quasi-ethical social rules that have been observed in the societies
of other mammals, it is obviously a historical fantasy). But we
could accept this account, as a historical explanation, without
thereby committing ourselves to any views about the lightness
or wrongness of the ethical system that has resulted. No matter
how self-interested the origins of ethics may be, it is possible
that once we have started thinking ethically we are led beyond
these mundane premises. For we are capable of reasoning, and
reason is not subordinate to self-interest. When we are reasoning about ethics, we are using concepts that, as we saw in the
first chapter of this book, take us beyond our own personal
interest, or even the interest of some sectional group. According
to the contract view of ethics, this universalising process should
stop at the boundaries of our community; but once the process
has begun we may come to see that it would not be consistent
with our other convictions to halt at that point. Just as the first
79 

mathematicians, who may have started counting in order to
keep track of the number of people in their tribe, had no idea
that they were taking the first steps along a path that would
lead to the infinitesimal calculus, so the origin of ethics tells us
nothing about where it will end.
When we turn to the question of justification, we can see that
contractual accounts of ethics have many problems. Clearly,
such accounts exclude from the ethical sphere a lot more than
nonhuman animals. Since severely intellectually disabled humans are equally incapable of reciprocating, they must also be
excluded. The same goes for infants and very young children;
but the problems of the contractual view are not limited to these
special cases. The ultimate reason for entering into the ethical
contract is, on this view, self-interest. Unless some additional
universal element is brought in, one group of people has no
reason to deal ethically with another if it is not in their interest
to do so. If we take this seriously we shall have to revise our
ethical judgments drastically. For instance, the white slave traders who transported African slaves to America had no selfinterested reason for treating Africans any better than they did.
The Africans had no way of retaliating. If they had only been
contractualists, the slave traders could have rebutted the abolitionists by explaining to them that ethics stops at the boundaries of the community, and since Africans are not part of their
community they have no duties to them.
Nor is it only past practices that would be affected by taking
the contractual model seriously. Though people often speak of
the world today as a single community, there is no doubt that
the power of people in, say, Chad, to reciprocate either good
or evil that is done to them by, say, citizens of the United States
is limited. Hence it does not seem that the contract view provides
for any obligations on the part of wealthy nations to poorer
nations.
Most striking of all is the impact of the contract model on
80 
?
our attitude to future generations. 'Why should I do anything
for posterity? What has posterity ever done for me?' would be
the view we ought to take if only those who can reciprocate
are within the bounds of ethics. There is no way in which those
w ho will be alive in the year 2100 can do anything to make
our lives better or worse. Hence if obligations only exist where
there can be reciprocity, we need have no worries about problems like the disposal of nuclear waste. True, some nuclear
wastes will still be deadly for a quarter of a million years; but
as long as we put it in containers that will keep it away from
us for 100 years, we have done all that ethics demands of us.
These examples should suffice to show that, whatever its
origin, the ethics we have now does go beyond a tacit understanding between beings capable of reciprocity. The prospect of
returning to such a basis will, I trust, not be appealing. Since
no account of the origin of morality compels us to base our
morality on reciprocity, and since no other arguments in favour
of this conclusion have been offered, we should reject this view
of ethics.
At this point in the discussion some contract theorists appeal
to a looser view of the contract idea, urging that we include
within the moral community all those who have or will have
the capacity to take part in a reciprocal agreement, irrespective
of whether they are in fact able to reciprocate, and irrespective,
too, of when they will have this capacity. Plainly, this view is
no longer based on reciprocity at all, for (unless we care greatly
about having our grave kept tidy or our memory preserved for
ever) later generations plainly cannot enter into reciprocal relationships with us, even though they will one day have the
capacity to reciprocate. If contract theorists abandon reciprocity
in this manner, however, what is left of the contract account?
Why adopt it at all? And why limit morality to those who have
the capacity to enter into agreements with us, if in fact there is
no possibility of them ever doing so? Rather than cling to the
81 

husk of a contract view that has lost its kernel, it would be
better to abandon it altogether, and consider, on the basis of
universalisability, which beings ought to be included within
morality.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH KILLING?
A
N oversimplified summary of the first three chapters of
this book might read like this: the first chapter sets up a
conception of ethics from which, in the second chapter, the
principle of equal consideration of interests is derived; this principle is then used to illuminate problems about the equality
of humans and, in the third chapter, applied to non-human
animals.
Thus the principle of equal consideration of interests has been
behind much of our discussion so far; but as I suggested in the
previous chapter, the application of this principle when lives
are at stake is less clear than when we are concerned with
interests like avoiding pain and experiencing pleasure. In this
chapter we shall look at some views about the value of life, and
the wrongness of taking life, in order to prepare the ground for
the following chapters in which we shall turn to the practical
issues of killing animals, abortion, euthanasia, and environmental ethics.
HUMAN LIFE
People often say that life is sacred. They almost never mean
what they say. They do not mean, as their words seem to imply,
that life itself is sacred. If they did, killing a pig or pulling up a
cabbage would be as abhorrent to them as the murder of a ^ ,
human being. When people say that life is sacred, it is human ' ''*Ty
.life they have in mind. But why should human life have special J
value? jf j 'f h- ~ *f" <»i /<•*.->.. .„]

In discussing the doctrine of the sanctity of human life I shall
not take the term 'sanctity' in a specifically religious sense. The
doctrine may well have a religious origin, as I shall suggest later
in this chapter, but it is now part of a broadly secular ethic, and
it is as part of this secular ethic that it is most influential today.
Nor shall I take the doctrine as maintaining that it is always
wrong to take human life, for this would imply absolute pacifism, and there are many supporters of the sanctity of human
life who concede that we may kill in self-defence. We may take
the doctrine of the sanctity of human life to be no more than
a way of saying that human life has some special value, a value
quite distinct from the value of the lives of other living things.
The view that human life has unique value is deeply rooted
in our society and is enshrined in our law. To see how far it
can be taken, I recommend a remarkable book: The Long Dying
of Baby Andrew, by Robert and Peggy Stinson. In December 1976
Peggy Stinson, a Pennsylvania schoolteacher, was twenty-four
weeks pregnant when she went into premature labor. The baby,
whom Robert and Peggy named Andrew, was marginally viable.
Despite a firm statement from both parents that they wanted
'no heroics', the doctors in charge of their child used all the
technology of modern medicine to keep him alive for nearly six
months. Andrew had periodic fits. Towards the end of that
period, it was clear that if he survived at all, he would be seriously and permanently impaired. Andrew was also suffering
considerably: at one point his doctor told the Stinsons that it
must 'hurt like hell' every time Andrew drew a breath. Andrew's
treatment cost $104,000, at 1977 cost levels - today it could
easily be three times that, for intensive care for extremely premature babies costs at least $1,500 per day.
Andrew Stinson was kept alive, against the wishes of his
parents, at a substantial financial cost, notwithstanding evident
suffering, and despite the fact that, after a certain point it was
clear that he would never be able to live an independent life,
or to think and talk in the way that most humans do. Whether
84 
?
such treatment of an infant human being is or is not the right
thing to do - and I come back to this question in Chapter 7 -
it makes a striking contrast with the casual way in which we
take the lives of stray dogs, experimental monkeys, and beef
cattle. What justifies the difference?
In every society known to us there has been some prohibition
on the taking of life. Presumably no society can survive if it
allows its members to kill one another without restriction. Precisely who is protected, however, is a matter on which societies
have differed. In many tribal societies the only serious offence
is to kill an innocent member of the tribe itself - members of
other tribes may be killed with impunity. In more sophisticated
nation-states protection has generally extended to all within the
nation's territorial boundaries, although there have been cases
- like slave-owning states - in which a minority was excluded.
Nowadays most agree, in theory if not in practice, that, apart
from special cases like self-defence, war, possibly capital punishment, and one or two other doubtful areas, it is wrong to
kill human beings irrespective of their race, religion, class, or
nationality. The moral inadequacy of narrower principles, limiting the respect for life to a tribe, race, or nation, is taken for
granted; but the argument of the preceding chapter must raise
doubts about whether the boundary of our species marks a more
defensible limit to the protected circle.
At this point we should pause to ask what we mean by terms
- like 'human life' or 'human being'. These terms figure prominently in debates about, for example, abortion. 'Is the fetus a
human being?' is often taken as the crucial question in the
abortion debate; but unless we think carefully about these terms
such questions cannot be answered.
It is possible to give 'human being' a precise meaning. We
can use it as equivalent to 'member of the species Homo sapiens'.
Whether a being is a member of a given species is something
that can be determined scientifically, by an examination of the
nature of the chromosomes in the cells of living organisms. In
85 

this sense there is no doubt that from the first moments of its
existence an embryo conceived from human sperm and eggs is
a human being; and the same is true of the most profoundly
and irreparably intellectually disabled human being, even of an
infant who is bom anencephalic - literally, without a brain.
There is another use of the term 'human', one proposed by
Joseph Fletcher, a Protestant theologian and a prolific writer on
ethical issues. Fletcher has compiled a list of what he calls 'indicators of humanhood' that includes the following: selfawareness, self-control, a sense of the future, a sense of the past,
the capacity to relate to others, concern for others, communication, and curiosity. This is the sense of the term that we have
in mind when we praise someone by saying that she is 'a real
human being' or shows 'truly human qualities'. In saying this
we are not, of course, referring to the person's membership in
the species Homo sapiens which as a matter of biological fact
is rarely in doubt; we are implying that human beings characteristically possess certain qualities, and this person possesses
them to a high degree.
These two senses of 'human being' overlap but do not coincide. The embryo, the later fetus, the profoundly intellectually
disabled child, even the newborn infant - all are indisputably
members of the species Homo sapiens, but none are self-aware,
have a sense of the future, or the capacity to relate to others.
Hence the choice between the two senses can make an important difference to how we answer questions like 'Is the fetus a
human being?'
When choosing which words to use in a situation like this
we should choose terms that will enable us to express our meaning clearly, and that do not prejudge the answer to substantive
questions. To stipulate that we shall use 'human' in, say, the
first of the two senses just described, and that therefore the fetus
is a human being and abortion is immoral would not do. Nor
would it be any better to choose the second sense and argue
86 
?
on this basis that abortion is acceptable. The morality of abortion
is a substantive issue, the answer to which cannot depend on
a stipulation about how we shall use words. In order to avoid
begging any questions, and to make my meaning clear, I shall
for the moment put aside the tricky term 'human' and substitute
two different terms, corresponding to the two different senses
of 'human'. For the first sense, the biological sense, I shall simply
use the cumbersome but precise expression 'member of the
species Homo sapiens' while for the second sense I shall use the
term 'person'.
This use of 'person' is itself, unfortunately, liable to mislead,
since 'person' is often used as if it meant the same as 'human
being'. Yet the terms are not equivalent; there could be a person
w ho is not a member of our species. There could also be members of our species who are not persons. The word 'person' has
its origin in the Latin term for a mask worn by an actor in
classical drama. By putting on masks the actors signified that
they were acting a role. Subsequently 'person' came to mean
one who plays a role in life, one who is an agent. According to
the Oxford Dictionary, one of the current meanings of the term
is 'a self-conscious or rational being'. This sense has impeccable
philosophical precedents. John Locke defines a person as 'A
thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can
consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times
and places.'
This definition makes 'person' close to what Fletcher meant
by 'human', except that it selects two crucial characteristics -
rationality and self-consciousness - as the core of the concept.
Quite possibly Fletcher would agree that these two are central,
and the others more or less follow from them. In any case, I
propose to use 'person', in the sense of a rational and selfconscious being, to capture those elements of the popular sense
of 'human being' that are not covered by 'member of the species
Homo sapiens'.
87 

The Value of the Life of Members of the Species
Homo Sapiens
With the clarification gained by our terminological interlude,
and the argument of the preceding chapter to draw upon, this
section can be very brief. The wrongness of inflicting pain on a
being cannot depend on the being's species: nor can the wrongness of killing it. The biological facts upon which the boundary
of our species is drawn do not have moral significance. To give
preference to the life of a being simply because that being is a
member of our species would put us in the same position as
racists who give preference to those who are members of their
race.
To those who have read the preceding chapters of this book,
this conclusion may seem obvious, for we have worked towards
it gradually; but it differs strikingly from the prevailing attitude
in our society, which as we have seen treats as sacred the lives
of all members of our species. How is it that our society should
have come to accept a view that bears up so poorly under critical
scrutiny? A short historical digression may help to explain.
If we go back to the origins of Western civilisation, to Greek
or Roman times, we find that membership of Homo sapiens
was not sufficient to guarantee that one's life would be protected. There was no respect for the lives of slaves or other
'barbarians'; and even among the Greeks and Romans themselves, infants had no automatic right to life. Greeks and Romans
killed deformed or weak infants by exposing them to the elements on a hilltop. Plato and Aristotle thought that the state
should enforce the killing of deformed infants. The celebrated
legislative codes said to have been drawn up by Lycurgus and
Solon contained similar provisions. In this period it was thought
better to end a life that had begun inauspiciously than to attempt
to prolong that life, with all the problems it might bring.
Our present attitudes date from the coming of Christianity.
There was a specific theological motivation for the Christian
88 
?
insistence on the importance of species membership: the belief
that all born of human parents are immortal and destined for
an eternity of bliss or for everlasting torment. With this belief,
the killing of Homo sapiens took on a fearful significance, since
it consigned a being to his or her eternal fate. A second Christian
doctrine that led to the same conclusion was the belief that since
we are created by God we are his property, and to kill a human
being is to usurp God's right to decide when we shall live and
when we shall die. As Thomas Aquinas put it, taking a human
life is a sin against God in the same way that killing a slave
would be a sin against the master to whom the slave belonged.
Non-human animals, on the other hand, were believed to have
been placed by God under man's dominion, as recorded in the
Bible (Genesis 1:29 and 9:1-3). Hence humans could kill nonhuman animals as they pleased, as long as the animals were
not the property of another.
During the centuries of Christian domination of European
thought the ethical attitudes based on these doctrines became
part of the unquestioned moral orthodoxy of European civilisation. Today the doctrines are no longer generally accepted,
but the ethical attitudes to which they gave rise fit in with the
deep-seated Western belief in the uniqueness and special privileges of our species, and have survived. Now that we are reassessing our speciesist view of nature, however, it is also time to
reassess our belief in the sanctity of the lives of members of our
species.
The Value of a Person's Life
We have broken down the doctrine of the sanctity of human
life into two separate claims, one that there is special value in
the life of a member of our species, and the other that there is
special value in the life of a person. We have seen that the
former claim cannot be defended. What of the latter? Is there
89 

special value in the life of a rational and self-conscious being,
as distinct from a being that is merely sentient?
One line of argument for answering this question affirmatively
runs as follows. A self-conscious being is aware of itself as a
distinct entity, with a past and a future. (This, remember, was
Locke's criterion for being a person.) A being aware of itself in
this way will be capable of having desires about its own future. ^
For example, a professor of philosophy may hope to write a
book demonstrating the objective nature of ethics; a student
may look forward to graduating; a child may want to go for a |
ride in an aeroplane. To take the lives of any of these people,
without their consent, is to thwart their desires for the future.
Killing a snail or a day-old infant does not thwart any desires
of this kind, because snails and newborn infants are incapable
of having such desires.
It may be said that when a person is killed we are not left
with a thwarted desire in the same sense in which I have a
thwarted desire when I am hiking through dry country and,
pausing to ease my thirst, discover a hole in my waterbottle. In
this case I have a desire that I cannot fulfil, and I feel frustration
and discomfort because of the continuing and unsatisfied desire
for water. When I am killed the desires I have for the future do
not continue after my death, and I do not suffer from their nonfulfilment. But does this mean that preventing the fulfilment of
these desires does not matter?
Classical utilitarianism, as expounded by the founding father
of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham, and refined by later philosophers like John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick, judges actions
by their tendency to maximise pleasure or happiness and minimise pain or unhappiness. Terms like 'pleasure' and 'happiness'
lack precision, but it is clear that they refer to something that
is experienced, or felt - in other words, to states of consciousness. According to classical utilitarianism, therefore, there is no
direct significance in the fact that desires for the future go un90
I 
?
fulfilled when people die. If you die instantaneously, whether
you have any desires for the future makes no difference to the
amount of pleasure or pain you experience. Thus for the classical
utilitarian the status of 'person' is not directly relevant to the
wrongness of killinjg.
Indirectly, however, being a person may be important for the
classical utilitarian. Its importance arises in the following manner. If I am a person, I have a conception of myself. I know
that I have a future. I also know that my future existence could
be cut short. If I think that this is likely to happen at any moment, my present existence will be fraught with anxiety, and
will presumably be less enjoyable than if I do not think it is
likely to happen for some time. If I learn that people like myself
are very rarely killed, I will worry less. Hence the classical utilitarian can defend a prohibition on killing persons on the indirect
ground that it will increase the happiness of people who would
otherwise worry that they might be killed. I call this an indirect
ground because it does not refer to any direct wrong done to
the person killed, but rather to a consequence of it for other
people. There is, of course, something odd about objecting to
murder, not because of the wrong done to the victim, but because of the effect that the murder will have on others. One
has to be a tough-minded classical utilitarian to be untroubled
by this oddness. (Remember, though, that we are now only
considering what is especially wrong about killing a person. The
classical utilitarian can still regard killing as wrong because it
eliminates the happiness that the victim would have experienced, had she lived. This objection to murder will apply to any
being likely to have a happy future, irrespective of whether the
being is a person.) For present purposes, however, the main
point is that this indirect ground does provide a reason for taking
the killing of a person, under certain conditions, more seriously
than the killing of a non-personal being. If a being is incapable
of conceiving of itself as existing over time, we need not take
91 
1

into account the possibility of it worrying about the prospect of
its future existence being cut short. It can't worry about this,
for it has no conception of its own future.
I said that the indirect classical utilitarian reason for taking
the killing of a person more seriously than the killing of a nonperson holds 'under certain conditions'. The most obvious of
these conditions is that the killing of the person may become
known to other persons, who derive from this knowledge a
more gloomy estimate of their own chances of living to a ripe
old age, or simply become fearful of being murdered. It is of
course possible that a person could be killed in complete secrecy,
so that no one else knew a murder had been committed. Then
this indirect reason against killing would not apply.
To this last point, however, a qualification must be made. In
the circumstances described in the last paragraph, the indirect
classical utilitarian reason against killing would not apply in so
far as we judge this individual case. There is something to be said,
however, against applying utilitarianism only or primarily at the
level of each individual case. It may be that in the long run, we
will achieve better results - greater overall happiness - if we
urge people not to judge each individual action by the standard
of utility, but instead to think along the lines of some broad
principles that will cover all or virtually all of the situations that
they are likely to encounter.
Several reasons have been offered in support of this approach.
R.M. Hare has suggested a useful distinction between two levels
of moral reasoning: the intuitive and the critical. To consider,
in theory, the possible circumstances in which one might maximise utility by secretly killing someone who wants to go on
living is to reason at the critical level. As philosophers, or just
as reflective, self-critical people, it can be interesting and helpful
to our understanding of ethical theory to think about such unusual hypothetical cases. Everyday moral thinking, however,
must be more intuitive. In real life we usually cannot foresee
all the complexities of our choices. It is simply not practical to
92 
?
try to calculate the consequences, in advance, of every choice
we make. Even if we were to limit ourselves to the more significant choices, there would be a danger that in many cases
we would be calculating in less than ideal circumstances. We
could be hurried, or flustered. We might be feeling angry, or
hurt, or competitive. Our thoughts could be coloured by greed,
or sexual desire, or thoughts of vengeance. Our own interests,
or the interests of those we love, might be at stake. Or we might
just not be very good at thinking about such complicated issues
as the likely consequences of a significant choice. For all these
reasons, Hare suggests, it will be better if, for our everyday
ethical life, we adopt some broad ethical principles and do not
deviate from them. These principles should include those that
experience has shown, over the centuries, to be generally conducive to producing the best consequences: and in Hare's view
that would include many of the standard moral principles, for
example, telling the truth, keeping promises, not harming others, and so on. Respecting the lives of people who want to go
on living would presumably be among these principles. Even
though, at the critical level, we can conceive of circumstances
in which better consequences would flow from acting against
one or more of these principles, people will do better on the
whole if they stick to the principles than if they do not.
On this view, soundly chosen intuitive moral principles
should be like a good tennis coach's instructions to a player.
The instructions are given with an eye to what will pay off most
of the time; they are a guide to playing "percentage tennis".
Occasionally an individual player might go for a freak shot, and
pull off a winner that has everyone applauding; but if the coach
is any good at all, deviations from the instructions laid down
will, more often than not, lose. So it is better to put the thought
of going for those freak shots out of one's mind. Similarly, if
we are guided by a set of well-chosen intuitive principles, we
may do better if we do not attempt to calculate the consequences
of each significant moral choice we must make, but instead
93 

consider what principles apply to it, and act accordingly. Perhaps
very occasionally we will find ourselves in circumstances in
which it is absolutely plain that departing from the principles
will produce a much better result than we will obtain by sticking
to them, and then we may be justified in making the departure.
But for most of us, most of the time, such circumstances will
not arise and can be excluded from our thinking. Therefore even
though at the critical level the classical utilitarian must concede
the possibility of cases in which it would be better not to respect
a person's desire to continue living, because the person could
be killed in complete secrecy, and a great deal of unalleviated
misery could thereby be prevented, this kind of thinking has
no place at the intuitive level that should guide our everyday
actions. So, at least, a classical utilitarian can argue.
That is, I think, the gist of what the classical utilitarian would
say about the distinction between killing a person and killing
some other type of being. There is, however, another version
of utilitarianism that gives greater weight to the distinction. This
other version of utilitarianism judges actions, not by their tendency to maximise pleasure or minimise pain, but by the extent
to which they accord with the preferences of any beings affected
by the action or its consequences. This version of utilitarianism
is known as 'preference utilitarianism'. It is preference utilitarianism, rather than classical utilitarianism, that we reach by
universalising our own interests in the manner described in the
opening chapter of this book - if, that is, we make the plausible
move of taking a person's interests to be what, on balance and
after reflection on all the relevant facts, a person prefers.
According to preference utilitarianism, an action contrary to
the preference of any being is, unless this preference is outweighed by contrary preferences, wrong. Killing a person who
prefers to continue living is therefore wrong, other things being
equal. That the victims are not around after the act to lament
the fact that their preferences have been disregarded is irrelevant. The wrong is done when the preference is thwarted.
94 
?
For preference utilitarians, taking the life of a person will
normally be worse than taking the life of some other being,
since persons are highly future-oriented in their preferences. To
kill a person is therefore, normally, to violate not just one, but
a wide range of the most central and significant preferences a
being can have. Very often, it will make nonsense of everything
that the victim has been trying to do in the past days, months,
or even years,, In contrast, beings who cannot see themselves
as entities with a future cannot have any preferences about their
o wn future existence. This is not to deny that such beings might
struggle against a situation in which their lives are in danger,
as a fish struggles to get free of the barbed hook in its mouth;
but this indicates no more than a preference for the cessation
of a state of affairs that is perceived as painful or frightening.
Struggle against danger and pain does not suggest that fish
are capable of preferring their own future existence to nonexistence. The behaviour of a fish on a hook suggests a reason
for not killing fish by that method, but does not in itself suggest
a preference utilitarian reason against killing fish by a method
that brings about death instantly, without first causing pain or
distress. (Again, remember that we are here considering what
is especially wrong about killing a person; I am not saying that
there are never any preference utilitarian reasons against killing
conscious beings who are not persons.)
Does a Person Have a Right to Life?
Although preference utilitarianism does provide a direct reason
for not killing a person, some may find the reason - even when
coupled with the important indirect reasons that any form of
utilitarianism will take into account - not sufficiently stringent.
Even for preference utilitarianism, the wrong done to the person
killed is merely one factor to be taken into account, and the
preference of the victim could sometimes be outweighed by the
preferences of others. Some say that the prohibition on killing
95 

people is more absolute than this kind of utilitarian calculation
implies. Our lives, we feel, are things to which we have a right,
and rights are not to be traded off against the preferences or
pleasures of others.
I am not convinced that the notion of a moral right is a helpful
or meaningful one, except when it is used as a shorthand way
of referring to more fundamental moral considerations. Nevertheless, since the idea that we have a 'right to life' is a popular
one, it is worth asking whether there are grounds for attributing
rights to life to persons, as distinct from other living beings.
Michael Tooley, a contemporary American philosopher, has
argued that the only beings who have a right to life are those
who can conceive of themselves as distinct entities existing over
time - in other words, persons, as we have used the term. His
argument is based on the claim that there is a conceptual connection between the desires a being is capable of having and
the rights that the being can be said to have. As Tooley puts it:
The basic intuition is that a right is something that can be violated
and that, in general, to violate an individual's right to something
is to frustrate the corresponding desire. Suppose, for example,
that you own a car. Then I am under a prima facie obligation
not to take it from you. However, the obligation is not unconditional: it depends in part upon the existence of a corresponding
desire in you. If you do not care whether I take your car, then
I generally do not violate your right by doing so.
Tooley admits that it is difficult to formulate the connections
between rights and desires precisely, because there are problem
cases like people who are asleep or temporarily unconscious.
He does not want to say that such people have no rights because
they have, at that moment, no desires. Nevertheless, Tooley
holds, the possession of a right must in some way be linked
with the capacity to have the relevant desires, if not with having
the actual desires themselves.
The next step is to apply this view about rights to the case of
the right to life. To put the matter as simply as possible - more
96 
?
simply than Tooley himself does and no doubt too simply - if
the right to life is the right to continue existing as a distinct
entity, then the desire relevant to possessing a right to life is the
desire to continue existing as a distinct entity. But only a being
who is capable of conceiving herself as a distinct entity existing
over time - that is, only a person - could have this desire.
Therefore only a person could have a right to life.
This is how Tooley first formulated his position, in a striking
article entitled "Abortion and Infanticide", first published in
1972. The problem of how precisely to formulate the connections between rights and desires, however, led Tooley to alter
his position in a subsequent book with the same title, Abortion
and Infanticide. He there argues that an individual cannot at a
given time - say, now - have a right to continued existence
unless the individual is of a kind such that it can now be in its
interests that it continue to exist. One might think that this
makes a dramatic difference to the outcome of Tooley's position,
for while a newborn infant would not seem to be capable of
conceiving itself as a distinct entity existing over time, we commonly think that it can be in the interests of an infant to be
saved from death, even if the death would have been entirely
without pain or suffering. We certainly do this in retrospect: I
might say, if I know that I nearly died in infancy, that the person
who snatched my pram from the path of the speeding train is
my greatest benefactor, for without her swift thinking I would
never have had the happy and fulfilling life that I am now living.
Tooley argues, however, that the retrospective attribution of an
interest in living to the infant is a mistake. I am not the infant
from whom I developed. The infant could not look forward to
developing into the kind of being I am, or even into any intermediate being, between the being I now am and the infant. I
cannot even recall being the infant; there are no mental links
between us. Continued existence cannot be in the interests of
a being who never has had the concept of a continuing self -
that is, never has been able to conceive of itself as existing over
97 

time. If the train had instantly killed the infant, the death would
not have been contrary to the interests of the infant, because
the infant would never have had the concept of existing over
time. It is true that I would then not be alive, but I can say that
it is in my interests to be alive only because I do have the concept
of a continuing self. I can with equal truth say that it is in my
interests that my parents met, because if they had never met,
they could not have created the embryo from which I developed,
and so I would not be alive. This does not mean that the creation
of this embryo was in the interests of any potential being who
was lurking around, waiting to be brought into existence. There
was no such being, and had I not been brought into existence,
there would not have been anyone who missed out on the life
I have enjoyed living. Similarly, we make a mistake if we now
construct an interest in future life in the infant, who in the first
days following birth can have no concept of continued existence,
and with whom I have no mental links.
Hence in his book Tooley reaches, though by a more circuitous route, a conclusion that is practically equivalent to the
conclusion he reached in his article. To have a right to life, one
must have, or at least at one time have had, the concept of
having a continued existence. Note that this formulation avoids
any problems in dealing with sleeping or unconscious people;
it is enough that they have had, at one time, the concept of
continued existence for us to be able to say that continued life
may be in their interests. This makes sense: my desire to continue living - or to complete the book I am writing, or to travel
around the world next year - does not cease whenever I am
not consciously thinking about these things. We often desire
things without the desire being at the forefront of our minds.
The fact that we have the desire is apparent if we are reminded
of it, or suddenly confronted with a situation in which we must
choose between two courses of action, one of which makes the
fulfilment of the desire less likely. In a similar way, when we
go to sleep our desires for the future have not ceased to exist.
98 
?
They will still be there, when we wake. As the desires are still
part of us, so, too, our interest in continued life remains part
of us while we are asleep or unconscious.
People and Respect for Autonomy
To this point our discussion of the wrongness of killing people
has focused on their capacity to envisage their future and have
desires related to it. Another implication of being a person may
also be relevant to the wrongness of killing. There is a strand
of ethical thought, associated with Kant but including many
modern writers who are not Kantians, according to which respect for autonomy is a basic moral principle. By 'autonomy'
is meant the capacity to choose, to make and act on one's own
decisions. Rational and self-conscious beings presumably have
this ability, whereas beings who cannot consider the alternatives
open to them are not capable of choosing in the required sense
and hence cannot be autonomous. In particular, only a being
who can grasp the difference between dying and continuing to
live can autonomously choose to live. Hence killing a person
who does not choose to die fails to respect that person's autonomy; and as the choice of living or dying is about the most
fundamental choice anyone can make, the choice on which all
other choices depend, killing a person who does not choose to
die is the gravest possible violation of that person's autonomy.
Not everyone agrees that respect for autonomy is a basic moral
principle, or a valid moral principle at all. Utilitarians do not
respect autonomy for its own sake, although they might give
great weight to a person's desire to go on living, either in a
preference utilitarian way, or as evidence that the person's life
was on the whole a happy one. But if we are preference utilitarians we must allow that a desire to go on living can be
outweighed by other desires, and if we are classical utilitarians
we must recognise that people may be utterly mistaken in their
expectations of happiness. So a utilitarian, in objecting to the
99 

killing of a person, cannot place the same stress on autonomy
as those who take respect for autonomy as an independent
moral principle. The classical utilitarian might have to accept
that in some cases it would be right to kill a person who does
not choose to die on the grounds that the person will otherwise
lead a miserable life. This is true, however, only on the critical
level of moral reasoning. As we saw earlier, utilitarians may
encourage people to adopt, in their daily lives, principles that
will in almost all cases lead to better consequences when followed than any alternative action. The principle of respect for
autonomy would be a prime example of such a principle. We
shall discuss actual cases that raise this issue shortly, in the
discussion of euthanasia in Chapter 7. ^
It may be helpful here to draw together our conclusions about
the value of a person's life. We have seen that there are four
possible reasons for holding that a person's life has some distinctive value over and above the life of a merely sentient being:
the classical utilitarian concern with the effects of the killing on
others; the preference utilitarian concern with the frustration
of the victim's desires and plans for the future; the argument
that the capacity to conceive of oneself as existing over time is
a necessary condition of a right to life; and respect for autonomy.
Although at the level of critical reasoning a classical utilitarian
would accept only the first, indirect, reason, and a preference
utilitarian only the first two reasons, at the intuitive level utilitarians of both kinds would probably advocate respect for autonomy too. The distinction between critical and intuitive levels
thus leads to a greater degree of convergence, at the level of
everyday moral decision making, between utilitarians and those
who hold other moral views than we would find if we took
into account only the critical level of reasoning. In any case,
none of the four reasons for giving special protection to the lives
of persons can be rejected out of hand. We shall therefore bear
all four in mind when we turn to practical issues involving
killing.
100 
?
Before we do turn to practical questions about killing, however, we have still to consider claims about the value of life that
are based neither on membership of our species, nor on being
a person.
CONSCIOUS LIFE
There are many beings who are sentient and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain, but are not rational and selfconscious and so not persons. I shall refer to these beings as
conscious being. Many non-human animals almost certainly
fall into this category; so must newborn infants and some
intellectually disabled humans. Exactly which of these lack
self-consciousness is something we shall consider in the next
chapters. If Tooley is right, those beings who do lack selfconsciousness cannot be said to have a right to life, in the full
sense of 'right'. Still, for other reasons, it might be wrong to kill
them. In the present section we shall ask if the life of a being
w ho is conscious but not self-conscious has value, and if so,
how the value of such a life compares with the value of a
person's life.
Should We Value Conscious Life?
The most obvious reason for valuing the life of a being capable
of experiencing pleasure or pain is the pleasure it can experience. If we value our own pleasures - like the pleasures of
eating, of sex, of running at full speed and of swimming on a
hot day - then the universal aspect of ethical judgments requires
us to extend our positive evaluation of our own experience of
these pleasures to the similar experiences of all who can experience them. But death is the end of all pleasurable experiences. Thus the fact that beings will experience pleasure in the
future is a reason for saying that it would be wrong to kill them.
Of course, a similar argument about pain points in the opposite
101 

direction, and it is only when we believe that the pleasure that
beings are likely to experience outweighs the pain they are likely
to suffer, that this argument counts against killing. So what this
amounts to is that we should not cutshort a plgasact life.
This seems simple enough: we value pleasure, killing those
who lead pleasant lives eliminates the pleasure they would
otherwise experience, therefore such killing is wrong. But stating the argument in this way conceals something that, once
noticed, makes the issue anything but simple. There are two
ways of reducing the amount of pleasure in the world: one is
to eliminate pleasures from the lives of those leading pleasant
lives; the other is to eliminate those leading pleasant lives. The
former leaves behind beings who experience less pleasure than
they otherwise would have. The latter does not. This means
that we cannot move automatically from a preference for a
pleasant life rather than an unpleasant one, to a preference for
a pleasant life rather than no life at all. For, it might be objected,
being killed does not make us worse off; it makes us cease to
exist. Once we have ceased to exist, we shall not miss the pleasure we would have experienced.
Perhaps this seems sophistical - an instance of the ability of
academic philosophers to find distinctions where there are no
significant differences. If that is what you think, consider the
opposite case: a case not of reducing pleasure, but of increasing
it. There are two ways of increasing the amount of pleasure in
the world: one is to increase the pleasure of those who now
exist; the other is to increase the number of those who will lead
pleasant lives. If killing those leading pleasant lives is bad because of the loss of pleasure, then it would seem to be good to
increase the number of those leading pleasant lives. We could
do this by having more children, provided we could reasonably
expect their lives to be pleasant, or by rearing large numbers of
animals under conditions that would ensure that their lives
would be pleasant. But would it really be good to create more
pleasure by creating more pleased beings?
102 
?
There seem to be two possible approaches to these perplexing
issues. The first approach is simply to accept that it is good to
increase the amount of pleasure in the world by increasing the
number of pleasant lives, and bad to reduce the amount of
pleasure in the world by reducing the number of pleasant lives.
This approach has the advantage of being straightforward and
clearly consistent, but it requires us to hold that if we could
increase the number of beings leading pleasant lives without
making others worse off, it would be good to do so. To see
whether you are troubled by this conclusion, it may be helpful
to consider a specific case. Imagine that a couple are trying to
decide whether to have children. Suppose that as far as their
own happiness is concerned, the advantages and disadvantages
balance out. Children will interfere with their careers at a crucial
stage of their professional lives, and they will have to give up
their favourite recreation, cross-country skiing, for a few years
at least. At the same time, they know that, like most parents,
they will get joy and fulfilment from having children and watching them develop. Suppose that if others will be affected, the
good and bad effects will cancel each other out. Finally, suppose
that since the couple could provide their children with a good
start in life, and the children would be citizens of a developed
nation with a high living standard, it is probable that their
children will lead pleasant lives. Should the couple count the
likely future pleasure of their children as a significant reason
for having children? I doubt that many couples would, but if
we accept this first approach, they should.
I shall call this approach the 'total' view since on this view
we aim to increase the total amount of pleasure (and reduce
the total amount of pain) and are indifferent whether this is
done by increasing the pleasure of existing beings, or increasing
the number of beings who exist.
The second approach is to count only beings who already
exist, prior to the decision we are taking, or at least will exist
independently of that decision. We can call this the 'prior ex103 

istence' view. It denies that there is value in increasing pleasure
by creating additional beings. The prior existence view is more
in harmony with the intuitive judgment most people have (I
think) that couples are under no moral obligation to have children when the children are likely to lead pleasant lives and no
one else is adversely affected. But how do we square the prior
existence view with our intuitions about the reverse case, when
a couple are considering having a child who, perhaps because
it will inherit a genetic defect, would lead a thoroughly miserable life and die before its second birthday? We would think
it wrong for a couple knowingly to conceive such a child; but
if the pleasure a possible child will experience is not a reason
for bringing it into the world, why is the pain a possible child
will experience a reason against bringing it into the world? The
prior existence view must either hold that there is nothing
wrong with bringing a miserable being into the world, or explain
the asymmetry between cases of possible children who are likely
to have pleasant lives, and possible children who are likely to
have miserable lives. Denying that it is bad knowingly to bring
a miserable child into the world is hardly likely to appeal to
those who adopted the prior existence view in the first place
because it seemed more in harmony with their intuitive judgments than the total view; but a convincing explanation of the
asymmetry is not easy to find. Perhaps the best one can say -
and it is not very good - is that there is nothing directly wrong
in conceiving a child who will be miserable, but once such a
child exists, since its life can contain nothing but misery, we
should reduce the amount of pain in the world by an act of
euthanasia. But euthanasia is a more harrowing process for the
parents and others involved than non-conception. Hence we
have an indirect reason for not conceiving a child bound to have
a miserable existence.
So is it wrong to cut short a pleasant life? We can hold that
it is, on either the total view or the prior existence view, but
our answers commit us to different things in each case. We can
104 
?
only take the prior existence approach if we accept that it is not
wrong to bring a miserable being into existence - or else offer
an explanation for why this should be wrong, and yet it not be
wrong to fail to bring into existence a being whose life will be
pleasant. Alternatively we can take the total approach, but then
we must accept that it is also good to create more beings whose
lives will be pleasant - and this has some odd practical implications. Some of these implications we have already seen. Others will become evident in the next chapter.
Comparing the Value of Different Lives
If we can give an affirmative - albeit somewhat shaky - answer
to the question whether the life of a being who is conscious but
not self-conscious has some value, can we also compare the
value of different lives, at different levels of consciousness or
self-consciousness? We are not, of course, going to attempt to
assign numerical values to the lives of different beings, or even
to produce an ordered list. The best that we could hope for is
some idea of the principles that, when supplemented with the
appropriate detailed information about the lives of different
beings, might serve as the basis for such a list. But the most
fundamental issue is whether we can accept the idea of ordering
the value of different lives at all.
Some say that it is anthropocentric, even speciesist, to order
the value of different lives in a hierarchical manner. If we do
so we shall, inevitably, be placing ourselves at the top and other
beings closer to us in proportion to the resemblance between
them and ourselves. Instead we should recognise that from the
points of view of the different beings themselves, each life is of
equal value. Those who take this view recognise, of course, that
a person's life may include the study of philosophy while a
mouse's life cannot; but they say that the pleasures of a mouse's
life are all that the mouse has, and so can be presumed to mean
as much to the mouse as the pleasures of a person's life mean
105 

to the person. We cannot say that the one is more or less valuable than the other.
Is it speciesist to judge that the life of a normal adult member
of our species is more valuable than the life of a normal adult
mouse? It would be possible to defend such a judgment only if
we can find some neutral ground, some impartial standpoint
from which we can make the comparison.
The difficulty of finding neutral ground is a very real practical
difficulty, but I am not convinced that it presents an insoluble
theoretical problem. I would frame the question we need to ask
in the following manner. Imagine that I have the peculiar property of being able to turn myself into an animal, so that like
Puck in A Midsummer-Night's Dream, 'Sometimes a horse I'll be,
sometimes a hound.' And suppose that when I am a horse, I
really am a horse, with all and only the mental experiences of
a horse, and when I am a human being I have all and only the
mental experiences of a human being. Now let us make the
additional supposition that I can enter a third state in which I
remember exactly what it was like to be a horse and exactly
what it was like to be a human being. What would this third
state be like? In some respects - the degree of self-awareness
and rationality involved, for instance - it might be more like a
human existence than an equine one, but it would not be a
human existence in every respect. In this third state, then, I
could compare horse-existence with human-existence. Suppose
that I were offered the opportunity of another life, and given
the choice of life as a horse or as a human being, the lives in
question being in each case about as good as horse or human
lives can reasonably be expected to be on this planet. I would
then be deciding, in effect, between the value of the life of a
horse (to the horse) and the value of the life of a human (to
the human).
Undoubtedly this scenario requires us to suppose a lot of
things that could never happen, and some things that strain our
imagination. The coherence of an existence in which one is
106 
?
neither a horse nor a human, but remembers what it was like
to be both, might be questioned. Nevertheless I think I can make
some sense of the idea of choosing from this position; and I am
fairly confident that from this position, some forms of life would
be seen as preferable to others.
If it is true that we can make sense of the choice between
existence as a mouse and existence as a human, then - whichever way the choice would go - we can make sense of the idea
that the life of one kind of animal possesses greater value than
the life of another; and if this is so, then the claim that the life
of every being has equal value is on very weak ground. We
cannot defend this claim by saying that every being's life is allimportant for it, since we have now accepted a comparison that
takes a more objective - or at least intersubjective - stance and
thus goes beyond the value of the life of a being considered
solely from the point of view of that being.
So it would not necessarily be speciesist to rank the value of
different lives in some hierarchical ordering. How we should go
about doing this is another question, and I have nothing better
to offer than the imaginative reconstruction of what it would
be like to be a different kind of being. Some comparisons may
be too difficult. We may have to say that we have not the
slightest idea whether it would be better to be a fish or a snake;
but then, we do not very often find ourselves forced to choose
between killing a fish or a snake. Other comparisons might not
be so difficult. In general it does seem that the more highly
developed the conscious life of the being, the greater the degree
of self-awareness and rationality and the broader the range of
possible experiences, the more one would prefer that kind of
life, if one were choosing between it and a being at a lower
level of awareness. Can utilitarians defend such a preference?
In a famous passage John Stuart Mill attempted to do so:
Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of
the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a
beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to
107 

be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person
of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though
they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal
is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs... It is
better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better
to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool,
or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know
their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison
knows both sides.
As many critics have pointed out, this argument is weak. Does
Socrates really know what it is like to be a fool? Can he truly
experience the joys of idle pleasure in simple things, untroubled
by the desire to understand and improve the world? We may
doubt it. But another significant aspect of this passage is less
often noticed. Mill's argument for preferring the life of a human
being to that of an animal (with which most modern readers
would be quite comfortable) is exactly paralleled by his argument for preferring the life of an intelligent human being to that
of fool. Given the context and the way in which the term "fool"
was commonly used in his day, it seems likely that by this he
means what we would now refer to as a person with an intellectual disability. With this further conclusion some modern
readers will be distinctly uncomfortable; but as Mill's argument
suggests, it is not easy to embrace the preference for the life of
a human over that of a non-human, without at the same time
endorsing a preference for the life of a normal human being
over that of another human at a similar intellectual level to that
of the non-human in the first comparison.
Mill's argument is difficult to reconcile with classical utilitarianism, because it just does not seem true that the more intelligent being necessarily has a greater capacity for happiness; and
even if we were to accept that the capacity is greater, the fact
that, as Mill acknowledges, this capacity is less often filled (the
fool is satisfied, Socrates is not) would have to be taken into
consideration. Would a preference utilitarian have a better prospect of defending the judgments Mill makes? That would de108 
?
pend on how we compare different preferences, held with
differing degrees of awareness and self-consciousness. It does
not seem impossible that we should find ways of ranking such
different preferences, but at this stage the question remains
open.
This chapter has focussed on the killing of conscious beings.
Whether there is anything wrong about taking non-conscious
life - the lives of trees or plants, for instance - will be taken up
in Chapter 10, on environmental ethics.
109 
TAKING LIFE: ANIMALS
I
N Chapter 4 we examined some general principles about the
value of life. In this and the following two chapters we shall
draw from that discussion some conclusions about three cases
of killing that have been the subject of heated debate: abortion,
euthanasia, and killing animals. Of these three, the question of
killing animals has probably aroused the least controversy;
nevertheless, for reasons that will become clear later, it is impossible to defend a position on abortion and euthanasia without taking some view about the killing of non-human animals.
So we shall look at that question first.
CAN A NON-HUMAN ANIMAL BE A PERSON?
We have seen that there are reasons for holding that the killing
of a person is more seriously wrong than the killing of a being
who is not a person. This is true whether we accept preference
utilitarianism, Tooley's argument about the right to life, or the
principle of respect for autonomy. Even a classical utilitarian
would say that there may be indirect reasons why it is worse
to kill a person. So in discussing the wrongness of killing nonhuman animals it is important to ask if any of them are persons.
It sounds odd to call an animal a person. This oddness may
be no more than a symptom of our habit of keeping our own
species sharply separated from others. In any case, we can avoid
the linguistic oddness by rephrasing the question in accordance
with our definition of 'person'. What we are really asking
is whether any non-human animals are rational and self110 

conscious beings, aware of themselves as distinct entities with
a past and a future.
Are animals self-conscious? There is now solid evidence that
some are. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence comes from apes
who can communicate with us using a human language. The
ancient dream of teaching our language to another species was
realised when two American scientists, Allen and Beatrice Gardner, guessed that the failure of previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to talk was due to the chimpanzees' lacking, not the
intelligence required for using language, but the vocal equipment needed to reproduce the sounds of human language. The
Gardners therefore decided to treat a young chimpanzee as if
she were a human baby without vocal chords. They communicated with her, and with each other when in her presence,
by using American Sign Language, a language widely used by
deaf people.
The technique was a striking success. The chimpanzee, whom
they called 'Washoe', learned to understand about 350 different
signs, and to use about 150 of them correctly. She put signs
together to form simple sentences. As for self-consciousness,
Washoe does not hesitate, when shown her own image in a
mirror and asked 'Who is that?' to reply: 'Me, Washoe.' Later
Washoe moved to Ellensburg, Washington, where she lived
with other chimpanzees under the care of Roger and Deborah
Fouts. Here she adopted an infant chimpanzee and soon began
not only signing to him, but even deliberately teaching him
signs, for example, by moulding his hands into the sign for 'food'
in an appropriate context.
Gorillas appear to be as good as chimpanzees at learning sign
language. Almost twenty years ago Francine Patterson began
signing and also speaking English with Koko, a lowland gorilla.
Koko now has a working vocabulary of over 500 signs, and she
has used about 1000 signs correctly on one or more occasions.
She understands an even larger number of spoken English
words. Her companion Michael, who began to be exposed to
111 

signs at a later age, has used about 400 signs. In front of a
mirror, Koko will make faces, or examine her teeth. When
asked: 'What's a smart gorilla?' Koko responded: 'Me.' When
someone remarked of Koko, in her presence, 'She's a goofball!'
Koko (perhaps not understanding the term) signed: 'No, gorilla.'
An orangutan, Chantek, has been taught sign language by
Lyn Miles. When shown a photograph of a gorilla pointing to
h er nose, Chantek was able to imitate the gorilla by pointing
to his own nose. This implies that he has an image of his own
body and can transfer that image from the two-dimensional
plane of the visual image to perform the necessary bodily action.
Apes also use signs to refer to past or future events, thus
showing a sense of time. Koko, for example, when asked, six
days after the event, what had happened on her birthday, signed
'sleep eat'. Even more impressive is the evidence of temporal
sense shown by the regular festivities held by the Fouts for the
chimpanzees at Ellensburg. Each year, after Thanksgiving,
Roger and Deborah Fouts set up a Christmas tree, covered with
edible ornaments. The chimpanzees use the sign combination
'candy tree' to refer to the Christmas tree. In 1989, when snow
began to fall just after Thanksgiving but the tree had not yet
appeared, a chimpanzee named Tatu asked 'Candy tree?' The
Fouts interpret this as showing not only that Tatu remembered
the tree, but also that she knew that this was the season for it.
Later Tatu also remembered that the birthday of one of the
chimpanzees, Dar, followed closely on that of Deborah Fouts.
The chimpanzees got ice cream for their birthdays; and after
the festivities for Deborah's birthday were over, Tatu asked: 'Dar
ice cream?'
Suppose that on the basis of such evidence we accept that
the signing apes are self-conscious. Are they exceptional among
all the non-human animals in this respect, precisely because
they can use language? Or is it merely that language enables
these animals to demonstrate to us a characteristic that they,
and other animals, possessed all along?
112 

Some philosophers have argued that thinking requires language: one cannot think without formulating one's thoughts in
words. The Oxford philosopher Stuart Hampshire, for example,
has written:
The difference here between a human being and an animal lies
in the possibility of the human being expressing his intention
and putting into words his intention to do so-and-so, for his own
benefit or for the benefit of others. The difference is not merely
that an animal in fact has no means of communicating, or of
recording for itself, its intention, with the effect that no one can
ever know what the intention was. It is a stronger difference,
which is more correctly expressed as the senselessness of attributing intentions to an animal which has not the means to reflect
upon, and to announce to itself or to others, its own future
behaviour... It would be senseless to attribute to an animal a
memory that distinguished the order of events in the past, and
it would be senseless to attribute to it an expectation of an order
of events in the future. It does not have the concepts of order,
or any concepts at all.
Obviously Hampshire was wrong to distinguish so crudely between humans and animals; for as we have just seen, the signing
apes have clearly shown that they do have 'an expectation of
an order of events in the future.' But Hampshire wrote before
apes had learned to use sign language, so this lapse may be
excusable. The same cannot be said for the much later defence
of the same view by another English philosopher, Michael
Leahy, in a book entitled Against Liberation. Like Hampshire,
Leahy argues that animals, lacking language, cannot have intentions, or act 'for a reason.'
Suppose that such arguments were to be re-phrased so that
they referred to animals who have not learned to use a language,
rather than all animals. Would they then be correct? If so, no
being without language can be a person. This applies, presumably, to young humans as well as to non-signing animals. It
might be argued that many species of animals do use language,
just not our language. Certainly most social animals have some
113 

means of communicating with each other, whether it be the
melodious songs of the humpback whales, the buzzes and whistles of dolphins, the howls and barks of dogs, the songs of birds,
and even the dance performed by honey bees returning to the
hive, from which other bees learn the distance and direction of
the food source from which the bee has come. But whether any
of these amount to language, in the required sense, is doubtful;
and since it would take us too far from our topic to pursue that
issue, I shall assume that they do not, and consider what can
be learned from the non-linguistic behaviour of animals.
Is the line of argument that denies intentional behaviour to
animals sound when it is limited to animals without language?
I do not believe that it is. Hampshire's and Leahy's argument^
are typical of those of many philosophers who have written
along similar lines, in that they are attempts to do philosophy
from the armchair, on a topic that demands investigation in the
real world. There is nothing altogether inconceivable about a
being possessing the capacity for conceptual thought without
having a language and there are instances of animal behaviour
that are extraordinarily difficult, if not downright impossible,
to explain except under the assumption that the animals are
thinking conceptually. In one experiment, for example, German
researchers presented a chimpanzee named Julia with two series
of five closed and transparent containers. At the end of one
series was a box with a banana; the box at the end of the other
series was empty. The box containing the banana could only
be opened with a distinctively shaped key; this was apparent
from looking at the box. This key could be seen inside another
locked box; and to open that box, Julia needed another distinctive key, which had to be taken out of a third box which
could only be opened with its own key, which was inside a
fourth locked box. Finally, in front of Julia, were two initial
boxes, open and each containing a distinctive key. Julia was
able to choose the correct initial key, by which she could open
the next box in the series that led, eventually, to the box with
114 

the banana. To do this, she must have been able to reason
backwards from her desire to open the box with the banana to
her need to have the key that would open it, to her need for
the key that would open that box, and so on. Since Julia had
not been taught any form of language, her behaviour proves
that beings without language can think in quite complex ways.
Nor is it only in laboratory experiments that the behaviour
of animals points to the conclusion that they possess both memory of the past and expectations about the future, and that they
are self-aware, that they form intentions and act on them. Frans
de Waal and his colleagues have for several years watched chimpanzees living in semi-natural conditions in two acres of forest
at Amsterdam Zoo. They have often observed co-operating activity that requires planning. For example, the chimpanzees like
to climb the trees and break off branches, so that they can eat
the leaves. To prevent the rapid destruction of the small forest,
the zookeepers have placed electric fencing around the trunk
of the trees. The chimpanzees overcome this by breaking large
branches from dead trees (which have no fences around them)
and dragging them to the base of a live tree. One chimpanzee
then holds the dead branch while another climbs up it, over
the fence and into the tree. The chimpanzee who gets into the
tree in this way shares the leaves thus obtained with the one
holding the branch.
De Waal has also observed deliberately deceptive behaviour
that clearly shows both self-consciousness and an awareness of
the consciousness of another. Chimpanzees live in groups in
which one male will be dominant and will attack other males
who mate with receptive females. Despite this, a good deal of
sexual activity goes on when the dominant male is not watching.
Male chimpanzees often seek to interest females in sexual activity by sitting with their legs apart, displaying their erect penis.
(Human males who expose themselves in a similar way are
continuing a form of chimpanzee behaviour that has become
socially inappropriate.) On one occasion a junior male was en115 

ticing a female in this manner when the dominant male walked
over. The junior male covered his erection with his hands so
that the dominant male could not see it.
Jane Goodall has described an incident showing forward
planning by Figan, a young wild chimpanzee in the Gombe
region of Tanzania. In order to bring the animals closer to her
observation post, Goodall had hidden some bananas in a tree:
One day, sometime after the group had been fed, Figan spotted
a banana that had been overlooked - but Goliath [an adult male
ranking above Figan in the group's hierarchy] was resting directly
underneath it. After no more than a quick glance from the fruit
to Goliath, Figan moved away and sat on the other side of the
tent so that he could no longer see the fruit. Fifteen minutes
later, when Goliath got up and left, Figan without a moment's
hesitation went over and collected the banana. Quite obviously
he had sized up the whole situation: if he had climbed for the
fruit earlier, Goliath would almost certainly have snatched it
away. If he had remained close to the banana, he would probably
have looked at it from time to time. Chimps are very quick to
notice and interpret the eye movements of their fellows, and
Goliath would possibly, therefore, have seen the fruit himself.
And so Figan had not only refrained from instantly gratifying his
desire but had also gone away so that he could not 'give the
game away' by looking at the banana.
Goodall's description of this episode does, of course, attribute
to Figan a complex set of intentions, including the intention to
avoid 'giving the game away' and the intention to obtain the
banana after Goliath's departure. It also attributes to Figan an
'expectation of an order of events in the future', namely the
expectation that Goliath would move away, that the banana
would still be there, and that he, Figan, would then go and get
it. Yet there seems nothing at all 'senseless' about these attributions, despite the fact that Figan cannot put his intentions or
expectations into words. If an animal can devise a careful plan
for obtaining a banana, not now but at some future time, and
can take precautions against his own propensity to give away
116 

the object of the plan, that animal must be aware of himself as
a distinct entity, existing over time.
KILLING NON-HUMAN PERSONS
Some non-human animals are persons, as we have defined the
term. To judge the significance of this we must set it in the
context of our earlier discussion, in which I argued that the only
defensible version of the doctrine of the sanctity of human life
was what we might call the 'doctrine of the sanctity of personal
life'. I suggested that if human life does have special value or a
special claim to be protected, it has it in so far as most, human
beings are persons. But if some non-human animals are persons,
too, the lives of those animals must have the same special value
or claim to protection. Whether we base these special moral
features of the lives of human persons on preferential utilitarianism, on a right to life deriving from their capacity to see
themselves as continuing selves, or on respect for autonomy,
these arguments must apply to non-human persons as well.
Only the indirect utilitarian reason for not killing persons - the
fear that such acts are likely to arouse in other persons - applies
less readily to non-human persons since non-humans are less
likely than humans to learn about killings that take place at a
distance from them. But then, this reason does not apply to all
killings of human persons either, since it is possible to kill in
such a way that no one learns that a person has been killed.
Hence we should reject the doctrine that places the lives of
members of our species above the lives of members of other
species. Some members of other species are persons: some members of our own species are not. No objective assessment can
support the view that it is always worse to kill members of our
species who are not persons than members of other species who
are. On the contrary, as we have seen there are strong arguments
for thinking that to take the lives of persons is, in itself, more
serious than taking the lives of non-persons. So it seems that
117 

killing, say, a chimpanzee is worse than the killing of a human
being who, because of a congenital intellectual disability, is not
and never can be a person.
At present the killing of a chimpanzee is not regarded as a
serious matter. Large numbers of chimpanzees are used in scientific research, and many of them die in the course of this
research. For many years, because chimpanzees were difficult
to breed in captivity, the corporations that supplied these animals captured them in African jungles. The standard method
was to shoot a female with an infant by her side. The infant
was then captured and shipped to Europe and the United States.
Jane Goodall has estimated that for every infant who reached
his or her destination alive, six chimpanzees died. Although
chimpanzees have been placed on the threatened list, and this
trade has now been banned, illegal killing and trading of chimpanzees, and of gorillas and orangutans, still continues.
The great apes - chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans - may
be the clearest cases of non-human persons, but there are almost
certainly others. Systematic observation of whales and dolphins
has, for obvious reasons, lagged far behind that of apes, and it
is quite possible that these large-brained mammals will turn out
to be rational and self-conscious. Despite an official moratorium,
the whaling industry slaughters thousands of whales annually
in the name of 'research', and the whaling nations are seeking
to overturn the International Whaling Commission's moratorium so that they can return to full-scale commercial whaling.
Closer to home, many of those who live with dogs and cats are
convinced that these animals are self-conscious and have a sense
of the future. They begin to expect their companion human
being to come home at a certain time. In her book Emma and
I, Sheila Hocken relates how her guide-dog spontaneously began to take her, every Friday, to the places where she did her
weekend shopping, without needing to be told the day. People
who feed feral cats on a weekly basis have found that they, too,
will turn up on the right day of the week. Such observations
118 

may be 'unscientific', but to those who know dogs and cats well
they are plausible and in the absence of better studies they
should be taken seriously. According to official United States
Department of Agriculture figures, approximately 140,000 dogs
and 42,000 cats die in laboratories in the United States each
year, and smaller but still sizeable numbers are used in every
'developed' nation. And if dogs and cats qualify as persons, the
mammals we use for food cannot be far behind. We think of
dogs as being more like people than pigs; but pigs are highly
intelligent animals and if we kept pigs as pets and reared dogs
for food, we would probably reverse our order of preference.
Are we turning persons into bacon?
Admittedly, all this is speculative. It is notoriously difficult to
establish when another being is self-conscious. But if it is wrong
to kill a person when we can avoid doing so, and there is real
doubt about whether a being we are thinking of killing is a
person, we should give that being the benefit of the doubt. The
rule here is the same as that among deer hunters: if you see
something moving in the bushes and are not sure if it is a deer
or a hunter, don't shoot! (We may think the hunters shouldn't
shoot in either case, but the rule is a sound one within the
ethical framework hunters use.) On these grounds, a great deal
of the killing of non-human animals must be condemned.
KILLING OTHER ANIMALS
Arguments against killing based on the capacity to see oneself
as an individual existing over time apply to some non-human
animals, but there are others who, though presumably conscious, cannot plausibly be said to be persons. Of those animals
that humans regularly kill in large numbers, fish appear to be
the clearest case of animals who are conscious but not persons.
The rightness or wrongness of killing these animals seems to
rest on utilitarian considerations, for they are not autonomous
119 

and - at least if Tooley's analysis of rights is correct - do not
qualify for a right to life.
Before we discuss the utilitarian approach to killing itself, we
should remind ourselves that a wide variety of indirect reasons
will figure in the utilitarian's calculations. Many modes of killing
used on animals do not inflict an instantaneous death, so there
is pain in the process of dying. There is also the effect of the
death of one animal on his or her mate or other members of
the animal's social group. There are many species of birds in
which the bond between male and female lasts for a lifetime.
The death of one member of this pair presumably causes distress,
and a sense of loss and sorrow for the survivor. The motherchild relationship in mammals can be a source of intense suffering if either is killed or taken away. (Dairy farmers routinely
remove calves from their mothers at an early age, so that the
milk will be available for humans; anyone who has lived on a
dairy farm will know that, for days after the calves have gone,
the cows keep calling for them.) In some species the death of
one animal may be felt by a larger group - as the behaviour of
wolves and elephants suggests. All these factors would lead the
utilitarian to oppose a lot of killing of animals, whether or not
the animals are persons. These factors would not, however, be
reasons for opposing killing non-persons in itself, apart from
the pain and suffering it may cause.
The utilitarian verdict on killing that is painless and causes
no loss to others is more complicated, because it depends on
how we choose between the two versions of utilitarianism outlined in the previous chapter. If we take what I called the 'prior
existence' view, we shall hold that it is wrong to kill any being
whose life is likely to contain, or can be brought to contain,
more pleasure than pain. This view implies that it is normally
wrong to kill animals for food, since usually we could bring it
about that these animals had a few pleasant months or even
years before they died - and the pleasure we get from eating
them would not outweigh this.
120 

The other version of utilitarianism - the 'total' view - can
lead to a different outcome that has been used to justify meateating. The nineteenth-century British political philosopher Leslie Stephen once wrote:
'Of all the arguments for Vegetarianism none is so weak as
the argument from humanity. The pig has a stronger interest
than anyone in the demand for bacon. If all the world were
Jewish, there would be no pigs at all.'
Stephen views animals as if they were replaceable, and with
this those who accept the total view must agree. The total version of utilitarianism regards sentient beings as valuable only
in so far as they make possible the existence of intrinsically
valuable experiences like pleasure. It is as if sentient beings are
receptacles of something valuable and it does not matter if a
receptacle gets broken, so long as there is another receptacle to
which the contents can be transferred without any getting spilt.
(This metaphor should not be taken too seriously, however;
unlike precious liquids, experiences like pleasure cannot exist
independently from a conscious being, and so even on the total
view, sentient beings cannot properly be thought of merely as
receptacles.) Stephen's argument is that although meat-eaters
are responsible for the death of the animal they eat and for the
loss of pleasure experienced by that animal, they are also responsible for the creation of more animals, since if no one ate
meat there would be no more animals bred for fattening. The
loss meat-eaters inflict on one animal is thus balanced, on the
total view, by the benefit they confer on the next. We may call
this 'the replaceability argument'.
The first point to note about the replaceability argument is
that even if it is valid when the animals in question have a
pleasant life it would not justify eating the flesh of animals reared
in modern factory farms, where the animals are so crowded
together and restricted in their movements that their lives seem
to be more of a burden than a benefit to them.
A second point is that if it is good to create happy life, then
121 

presumably it is good for there to be as many happy beings on
our planet as it can possibly hold. Defenders of meat-eating had
better hope that they can find a reason why it is better for there
to be happy people rather than just the maximum possible number of happy beings, because otherwise the argument might
imply that we should eliminate almost all human beings in order
to make way for much larger numbers of smaller happy animals.
If, however, the defenders of meat-eating do come up with a
reason for preferring the creation of happy people to, say, happy
mice, then their argument will not support meat-eating at all.
For with the possible exception of arid areas suitable only for
pasture, the surface of our globe can support more people if we
grow plant foods than if we raise animals.
These two points greatly weaken the replaceability argument
as a defence of meat-eating, but they do not go to the heart of
the matter. Are some sentient beings really replaceable? The
response to the first edition of this book suggests that the replaceability argument is probably the most controversial, and
widely criticised, argument in this book. Unfortunately none of
the critics have offered satisfactory alternative solutions to the
underlying problems to which replaceability offers one - if not
very congenial — answer.
Henry Salt, a nineteenth-century English vegetarian and author of a book called Animals' Rights thought that the argument
rested on a simple philosophical error:
The fallacy lies in the confusion of thought that attempts to
compare existence with non-existence. A person who is already
in existence may feel that he would rather have lived than not,
but he must first have the terra firma of existence to argue from:
the moment he begins to argue as if from the abyss of the nonexistent, he talks nonsense, by predicating good or evil, happiness
or unhappiness, of that of which we can predicate nothing.
When I wrote the first edition of Animal Liberation I accepted
Salt's view. I thought that it was absurd to talk as if one conferred a favour on a being by bringing it into existence, since
122 

at the time one confers this favour, there is no being at all. But
now I am less confident. After all, as we saw in Chapter 4, we
do seem to do something bad if we knowingly bring a miserable
being into existence, and if this is so, it is difficult to explain
why we do not do something good when we knowingly bring
a happy being into existence.
Derek Parfit has described another hypothetical situation that
amounts to an even stronger case for the replaceability view.
He asks us to imagine that two women are each planning to
have a child. The first woman is already three months pregnant
when her doctor gives her both bad and good news. The bad
news is that the fetus she is carrying has a defect that will
significantly diminish the future child's quality of life - although
not so adversely as to make the child's life utterly miserable, or
not worth living at all. The good news is that this defect is easily
treatable. All the woman has to do is take a pill that will have
no side-effects, and the future child will not have the defect. In
this situation, Parfit plausibly suggests, we would all agree that
the woman should take the pill, and that she does wrong if she
refuses to take it.
The second woman sees her doctor before she is pregnant,
when she is about to stop using contraception, and also receives
bad and good news. The bad news is that she has a medical
condition that has the effect that if she conceives a child within
the next three months, that child will have a significant defect
- with exactly the same impact on the child's quality of life as
the defect described in the previous paragraph. This defect is
not treatable, but the good news is that the woman's condition
is a temporary one, and if she waits three months before becoming pregnant, her child will not have the defect. Here too,
Parfit suggests, we would all agree that the woman should wait
before becoming pregnant, and that she does wrong if she does
not wait.
Suppose that the first woman does not take the pill, and the
second woman does not wait before becoming pregnant, and
123 

that as a result each has a child with a significant disability. It
would seem that they have each done something wrong. Are
their wrong-doings of equal magnitude? If we assume that it
would have been no greater hardship for the second woman to
wait three months before becoming pregnant than it would have
been for the first woman to take the pill, it would seem that
the answer is yes, what each has done is equally wrong. But
now consider what this answer implies. The first woman has
harmed her child. That child can say to her mother: 'You should
have taken the pill. If you had done so, I would not now have
this disability, and my life would be significantly better.' But if
the child of the second woman tries to make the same claim,
her mother has a devastating response. She can say: 'If I had
waited three months before becoming pregnant you would
never have existed. I would have produced another child, from
a different egg and different sperm. Your life, even with your
disability, is definitely above the point at which life is so miserable that it ceases to be worth living. You never had a chance
of existing without the disability. So I have not harmed you at
all.' This reply seems a complete defence to the charge of having
harmed the child now in existence. If, despite this, we persist
in our belief that it was wrong of the woman not to postpone
her pregnancy, where does the wrongness lie? It cannot lie in
bringing into existence the child to whom she gave birth, for
that child has an adequate quality of life. Could it lie in not
bringing a possible being into existence - to be precise, in not
bringing into existence the child she would have had if she had
waited three months? This is one possible answer, but it commits us to the total view, and implies that, other things being
equal, it is good to bring into existence children without disabilities. A third possibility is that the wrong-doing lies, not in
harming an identifiable child, nor simply in omitting to bring
a possible child into existence, but in bringing into existence a
child with a less satisfactory quality of life than another child
whom one could have brought into existence. In other words,
124 

we have failed to bring about the best possible outcome. This
last seems the most plausible answer, but it too suggests that at
least possible people are replaceable. The question then becomes
this: At what stage in the process that passes from possible
people to actual people does replaceability cease to apply? What
characteristic makes the difference?
If we think of living creatures - human or non-human - as
self-conscious individuals, leading their own lives and wanting
to go on living, the replaceability argument holds little appeal.
It is possible that when Salt so emphatically rejected the idea
of replaceability, he was thinking of such beings, for he concludes the essay quoted above by claiming that Lucretius long
ago refuted Stephen's 'vulgar sophism' in the following passage
of De Rerum Natura:
What loss were ours, if we had known not birth?
Let living men to longer life aspire,
While fond affection binds their hearts to earth:
But who never hath tasted life's desire,
Unborn, impersonal, can feel no dearth.
This passage supports the claim that there is a difference between
killing living beings who 'to longer life aspire' and failing to
create a being who, unborn and impersonal, can feel no loss of
life. But what of beings who, though alive, cannot aspire to
longer life, because they lack the conception of themselves as
living beings with a future? These being are, in a sense, 'impersonal'. Perhaps, therefore, in killing them, one does them
no personal wrong, although one does reduce the quantity of
happiness in the universe. But this wrong, if it is wrong, can
be counter-balanced by bringing into existence similar beings
w ho will lead equally happy lives. So perhaps the capacity to
see oneself as existing over time, and thus to aspire to longer
life (as well as to have other non-momentary, future-directed
interests) is the characteristic that marks out those beings who
cannot be considered replaceable.
Although we shall return to this topic in the next two chap125 

ters, we can note here that this conclusion is in harmony with
Tooley's views about what it takes to have a right to life. For a
preference utilitarian, concerned with the satisfaction of preferences rather than experiences of suffering or happiness, there
is a similar fit with the distinction already drawn between killing
those who are rational and self-conscious beings, and those who
are not. Rational, self-conscious beings are individuals, leading
lives of their own and cannot in any sense be regarded merely
as receptacles for containing a certain quantity of happiness.
They have, in the words of the American philosopher James
Rachels, a life that is biographical, and not merely biological.
In contrast, beings who are conscious, but not self-conscious,
more nearly approximate the picture of receptacles for experiences of pleasure and pain, because their preferences will be of
a more immediate sort. They will not have desires that project
their images of their own existence into the future. Their conscious states are not internally linked over time. We can presume
that if fish become unconscious, then before the loss of consciousness they would have no expectations or desires for anything that might happen subsequently, and if they regain
consciousness, they have no awareness of having previously
existed. Therefore if the fish were killed while unconscious and
replaced by a similar number of other fish who could be created
only because the first group of fish were killed, there would,
from the perspective of fishy awareness, be no difference between that and the same fish losing and regaining consciousness.
For a non-self-conscious being death is the cessation of experiences, in much the same way that birth is the beginning of
experiences. Death cannot be contrary to an interest in continued life, any more than birth could be in accordance with an
interest in commencing life. To this extent, with non-selfconscious life, birth and death cancel each other out; whereas
with self-conscious beings the fact that once self-conscious one
126 

may desire to continue living means that death inflicts a loss
for which the birth of another is insufficient compensation.
The test of universalisability supports this view. If I imagine
myself in turn as a self-conscious being and a conscious but not
self-conscious being, it is only in the former case that I could
have forward-looking desires that extend beyond periods of
sleep or temporary unconsciousness, for example a desire to
complete my studies, a desire to have children, or simply a desire
to go on living, in addition to desires for immediate satisfaction
or pleasure, or to get out of painful or distressing situations.
Hence it is only in the former case that my death involves a
greater loss than just a temporary loss of consciousness, and is
not adequately compensated for by the creation of a being with
similar prospects of pleasurable experiences.
In reviewing the first edition of this book H. L. A. Hart, formerly professor of jurisprudence at the University of Oxford,
suggested that for a utilitarian, self-conscious beings must be
replaceable in just the same way as non-self-conscious beings
are. Whether one is a preference utilitarian or a classical utilitarian will, in Hart's view, make no difference here, because
preference Utilitarianism is after all a form of maximizing utilitarianism: it requires that the overall satisfaction of different persons' preferences be maximized just as Classical Utilitarianianism
requires overall experienced happiness to be maximized... If
preferences, even the desire to live, may be outweighed by the
preferences of others, why cannot they be outweighed by new
preferences created to take their place?
It is of course true that preference utilitarianism is a form of
maximising utilitarianism in the sense that it directs us to maximise the satisfaction of preferences, but Hart is on weaker
ground when he suggests that this must mean that existing
preferences can be outweighed by new preferences created to
take their place. For while the satisfaction of an existing preference is a good thing, the package deal that involves creating
127 

and then satisfying a preference need not be thought of as equivalent to it. Again, universalisability supports this way of conceiving preference utilitarianism. If I put myself in the place of
another with an unsatisfied preference, and ask myself if I want
that preference satisfied, the answer is (tautologically) yes. If,
however, I ask myself whether I wish to have a new preference
created that can then be satisfied, I will be quite uncertain. If I
think of a case in which the satisfaction of the preference will
be highly pleasurable, I may say yes. (We are glad that we are
hungry if delicious food is on the table before us, and strong
sexual desires are fine when we are able to satisfy them.) But
if I think of the creation of a preference that is more like a
privation, I will say no. (We don't cause ourselves headaches
simply in order to be able to take aspirin and thus satisfy our
desire to be free of the pain.) This suggests that the creation and
satisfaction of a preference is in itself neither good nor bad: our
response to the idea of the creation and satisfaction of a preference varies according to whether the experience as a whole
will be desirable or undesirable, in terms of other, long-standing
preferences we may have, for example for pleasure rather than
pain.
Exactly how preference utilitarianism ought to evaluate the
creation and satisfaction of a preference, as distinct from the
satisfaction of an existing preference, is a difficult issue. In my
initial response to Hart's criticism, I suggested that we think of
the creation of an unsatisfied preference as putting a debit in a
kind of moral ledger that is merely cancelled out by the satisfaction of the preference. (Some will see in this model confirmation of Marx's scornful remark that Bentham's utilitarianism
is a philosophy suitable for a nation of shopkeepers!) The 'moral
ledger' model has the advantage of explaining the puzzling
asymmetry mentioned in the previous chapter, in connection
with the difference between the total and the prior existence
interpretations of utilitarianism. We consider it wrong to bring
into existence a child who, because of a genetic defect, will lead
128 

a thoroughly miserable existence for a year or two and then
die; yet we do not consider it good or obligatory to bring into
existence a child who, in all probability, will lead a happy life.
The 'debit' view of preferences just outlined would explain why
this should be so: to bring into existence a child, most of whose
preferences we will be unable to satisfy, is to create a debit that
we cannot cancel. This is wrong. To create a child whose preferences will be able to be satisfied, is to create a debit that can
be cancelled. This is, in itself, I thought, ethically neutral. The
model can also explain why, in Parfit's example, what the two
women do is equally wrong - for both quite unnecessarily bring
into existence a child who is likely to have a larger negative
balance in the ledger than a child they could have brought into
existence.
Unfortunately, this same view carries a less desirable implication: it makes it wrong, other things being equal, to bring
into existence a child- who will on the whole be very happy,
and will be able to satisfy nearly all of her preferences, but will
still have some preferences unsatisfied. For if the creation of
each preference is a debit that is cancelled only when the desire
is satisfied, even the best life will, taken in itself, leave a small
debit in the ledger. Since everyone has some unsatisfied desires,
the conclusion to be drawn is that it would have been better if
none of us had been born. Thus the moral ledger model of
creating and satisfying a preference will not do. It might be
saved by attaching to it a stipulation that sets a given level of
preference satisfaction, below complete satisfaction, as a minim um for overcoming the negative entry opened by the creation
of a being with unsatisfied preferences. This might be the level
at which we consider a life ceases to be worth living, from the
perspective of the person leading that life. Such a solution seems
a little ad hoc, but it may be possible to incorporate it into a
plausible version of preference utilitarianism.
Another possibility is to take our model from Shakespeare,
who speaks of 'life's uncertain voyage', and see the lives of self129 

conscious beings as arduous and uncertain journeys, at different
stages, in which various amounts of hope and desire, as well
as time and effort have been invested in order to reach particular
goals or destinations. Suppose that I am thinking of travelling
to Nepal, where I plan to trek to Thyangboche Monastery, at
the base of Mt. Everest. I have always loved high mountains,
and I know that I would enjoy being in the Himalayas for the
first time. If during these early days of musing on the possibility
of such a trip an insuperable obstacle arises - perhaps the Nepalese government bans tourism on the grounds that it is an
environmental hazard - I will be a little put out, naturally, but
my disappointment will be nothing compared with what it
would have been if I had already arranged to take the necessary
time off work, perhaps bought a non-refundable plane ticket to
Kathmandu, or even trekked a long distance towards my destination, before being barred from reaching my goal. Similarly,
one can regard a decision not to bring an infant into the world
as akin to preventing a journey from getting underway, but this
is not in itself seriously wrong, for the voyager has made no
plans and set no goals. Gradually, as goals are set, even if tentatively, and a lot is done in order to increase the probability
of the goals being reached, the wrongness of bringing the journey to a premature end increases. Towards the end of life, when
most things that might have been achieved have either been
done, or are now unlikely to be accomplished, the loss of life
may again be less of tragedy than it would have been at an
earlier stage of life.
The great virtue of this 'journey' model of a life is that it can
explain why beings who can conceive of their own future existence and have embarked on their life journey are not replaceable, while at the same it can account for why it is wrong
to bring a miserable being into existence. To do so is to send a
being out on a journey that is doomed to disappointment and
frustration. The model also offers a natural explanation of why
Parfit's two women both do wrong, and to an equal degree:
130 

they both quite unnecessarily send out voyagers with fewer
prospects of making a successful journey than other voyagers
whom they might have placed at the starting line. The women's
children can be thought of as replaceable before the journey
begins, but this does not require us to hold that there is an
obligation to bring more children into existence, let alone to
regard people as replaceable once life's journey has properly
begun.
Both the modified moral ledger model and the journey model
are metaphors, and should not be taken too literally. At best
they suggest ways of thinking about when beings might be
considered replaceable, and when they might not be so considered. As I indicated in the Preface, this is an area in which fully
satisfactory answers are still to be found.
Before we leave the topic of killing non-self-conscious beings,
I should emphasise that to take the view that non-self-conscious
beings are replaceable is not to say that their interests do not
count. I hope that the third chapter of this book makes it clear
that their interests do count. As long as sentient beings are
conscious, they have an interest in experiencing as much pleasure and as little pain as possible. Sentience suffices to place a
being within the sphere of equal consideration of interests; but
it does not mean that the being has a personal interest in continuing to live.
CONCLUSIONS
If the arguments in this chapter are correct, there is no single
answer to the question: 'Is it normally wrong to take the life of
an animal?' The term 'animal' - even in the restricted sense of
'non-human animal' - covers too diverse a range of lives for
one principle to apply to all of them.
Some non-human animals appear to be rational and selfconscious, conceiving themselves as distinct beings with a past
and a future. When this is so, or to the best of our knowledge
131 

may be so, the case against killing is strong, as strong as the
case against killing permanently intellectually disabled human
beings at a similar mental level. (I have in mind here the direct
reasons against killing; the effects on relatives of the intellectually disabled human will sometimes - but not always - constitute additional indirect reasons against killing the human. For
further discussion of this issue, see Chapter 7.)
In the present state of our knowledge, this strong case against
killing can be invoked most categorically against the slaughter
of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. On the basis of what
we now know about these near-relatives of ours, we should
immediately extend to them the same full protection against
being killed that we extend now to all human beings. A case
can also be made, though with varying degrees of confidence,
on behalf of whales, dolphins, monkeys, dogs, cats, pigs, seals,
bears, cattle, sheep and so on, perhaps even to the point at
which it may include all mammals - much depends on how
far we are prepared to go in extending the benefit of the doubt,
where a doubt exists. Even if we stopped at the species I have
named, however - excluding the remainder of the mammals -
our discussion has raised a very large question mark over the
justifiability of a great deal of killing of animals carried out by
humans, even when this killing takes place painlessly and without causing suffering to other members of the animal community. (Most of this killing, of course, does not take place
under such ideal conditions.)
When we come to animals who, as far as we can tell, are not
rational and self-conscious beings, the case against killing is
weaker. When we are not dealing with beings aware of themselves as distinct entities, the wrongness of painless killing derives from the loss of pleasure it involves. Where the life taken
would not, on balance, have been pleasant, no direct wrong is
done. Even when the animal killed would have lived pleasantly,
it is at least arguable that no wrong is done if the animal killed
will, as a result of the killing, be replaced by another animal
132 

living an equally pleasant life. Taking this view involves holding
that a wrong done to an existing being can be made up for by
a benefit conferred on an as yet non-existent being. Thus it is
possible to regard non-self-conscious animals as interchangeable with each other in a way that self-conscious beings are not.
This means that in some circumstances - when animals lead
pleasant lives, are killed painlessly, their deaths do not cause
suffering to other animals, and the killing of one animal makes
possible its replacement by another who would not otherwise
have lived - the killing of non-self-conscious animals may
not be wrong.
^ Is it possible, along these lines, to justify raising chickens for
their meat, not in factory farm conditions but roaming freely
around a farmyard? Let us make the questionable assumption
that chickens are not self-conscious. Assume also that the birds
can be killed painlessly, and the survivors do not appear to be
affected by the death of one of their numbers. Assume, finally,
that for economic reasons we could not rear the birds if we did
not eat them. Then the replaceability argument appears to justify
killing the birds, because depriving them of the pleasures of
their existence can be offset against the pleasures of chickens
who do not yet exist, and will exist only if existing chickens are
killed.
As a piece of critical moral reasoning, this argument may be
sound. Even at that level, it is important to realise how limited
it is in its application. It cannot justify factory farming, where
animals do not have pleasant lives. Nor does it normally justify
the killing of wild animals. A duck shot by a hunter (making
the shaky assumption that ducks are not self-conscious, and the
almost certainly false assumption that the shooter can be relied
upon to kill the duck instantly) has probably had a pleasant
life, but the shooting of a duck does not lead to its replacement
by another. Unless the duck population is at the maximum that
can be sustained by the available food supply, the killing of a
duck ends a pleasant life without starting another, and is for
133
1 

that reason wrong on straightforward utilitarian grounds. So
although there are situations in which it is not wrong to kill
animals, these situations are special ones, and do not cover very
many of the billions of premature deaths humans inflict, year
after year, on animals.
In any case, at the level of practical moral principles, it would
be better to reject altogether the killing of animals for food,
unless one must do so to survive. Killing animals for food makes
us think of them as objects that we can use as we please. Their
lives then count for little when weighed against our mere wants.
As long as we continue to use animals in this way, to change
our attitudes to animals in the way that they should be changed
will be an impossible task. How can we encourage people to
respect animals, and have equal concern for their interests, if
they continue to eat them for their mere enjoyment? To foster
the right attitudes of consideration for animals, including nonself-conscious ones, it may be best to make it a simple principle
to avoid killing them for food.

TAKING LIFE: THE EMBRYO
AND THE FETUS
THE PROBLEM
F
EW ethicalissues are as bitterly fought over today as abortion, and, while the pendulum has swung back and forth,
neither side has had much success in altering the opinions of
its opponents. Until 1967, abortion was illegal in almost all the
Western democracies except Sweden and Denmark. Then Britain changed its law to allow abortion on broad social grounds,
and in the 1973 case of Roe v Wade, the United States Supreme
Court held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion in the first six months of pregnancy. Western European
nations, including Roman Catholic countries like Italy, Spain
and France, all liberalised their abortion laws. Only the Republic
of Ireland held out against the trend.
Opponents of abortion did not give up. In the United States,
conservative Presidents have changed the composition of the
Supreme Court, which in turn has nibbled around the margins
of the Roe v Wade decision, allowing states to restrict, in various
ways, access to abortion. Outside the United States, the issue
of abortion re-surfaced in Eastern Europe after the collapse of
communism. The communist states had allowed abortion, but
as nationalist and religious forces gathered strength, there were
strong moves in countries like Poland for the re-introduction
of restrictive laws. Since West Germany had more restrictive
laws than East Germany, the need to introduce a single law for
a united Germany also caused an intense debate.
In 1978 the birth of Louise Brown raised a new issue about
135 

the status of early human life. For Louise Brown was the first
human to have been born from an embryo that had been fertilised outside a human body. The success of Robert Edwards
and Patrick Steptoe in demonstrating the possibility of in vitro
fertilization, or 1VF, was based on several years of experimentation on early human embryos - none of which had survived.
IVF is now a routine procedure for certain types of infertility,
and has given rise to thousands of healthy babies. To reach this
point, however, many more embryos had to be destroyed in
experiments, and further improvement of IVF techniques will
require continued experimentation. Perhaps more significant
still, for the long-term, are the possibilities for other forms of
experimentation opened up by the existence of a viable embryo
outside the human body. Embryos can now be frozen and stored
for many years before being thawed and implanted in a woman.
Normal children develop from these embryos, but the technique
means that there are large numbers of embryos now preserved
in special freezers around the world. (At the time of writing
there were about 11,000 frozen embryos in Australia alone.)
Because the IVF procedure often produces more embryos than
can safely be transferred to the uterus of the woman from whom
the egg came, many of these frozen embryos will never be
wanted, and presumably will either be destroyed, be donated
for research, or given to other infertile couples.
Other new technologies loom just a little way ahead. Embryos
can be screened for genetic abnormalities, and then discarded
if such abnormalities are found. Edwards has predicted that it
will become scientifically feasible to grow embryos in vitro to
the point at which, about 17 days after fertilisation, they develop
blood stem cells, which could be used to treat various nowlethal blood diseases. Others, speculating about the further future, have asked if one day we will have banks of embryos or
fetuses to provide organs for those who need them.
Abortion and destructive embryo experimentation pose dif136 

ficult ethical issues because the development of the human being
is a gradual process. If we take the fertilised egg immediately
after conception, it is hard to get upset about its death. The
fertilised egg is a single cell. After several days, it is still only a
tiny cluster of cells without a single anatomical feature of the
being it will later become. The cells that will eventually become
the embryo proper are at this stage indistinguishable from the
cells that will become the placenta and amniotic sac. Up to about
14 days after fertilisation, we cannot even tell if the embryo is
going to be one or two individuals, because splitting can take
place, leading to the fonriation of identical twins. At 14 days,
the first anatomical feature, the so-called primitive streak, appears in the position in which the backbone will later develop.
At this point the embryo could not possibly be conscious or feel
pain. At the other extreme is the adult human being. To kill a
human adult is murder, and, except in some special circumstances like those to be discussed in the next chapter, is unhesitatingly and universally condemned. Yet there is no obvious
sharp line that divides the fertilised egg from the adult. Hence
the problem.
Most of this chapter will be concerned with the problem of
abortion, but the discussion of the status of the fetus will have
obvious implications for two related issues: embryo experimentation, and the use of fetal tissue for medical purposes. I
begin the discussion of abortion stating the position of those
opposed to abortion, which I shall refer to as the conservative
position. I shall then examine some of the standard liberal responses, and show why they are inadequate. Finally I shall use
our earlier discussion of the value of life to approach the issue
from a broader perspective. In contrast to the common opinion
that the moral question about abortion is a dilemma with no
solution, I shall show that, at least within the bounds of nonreligious ethics, there is a clear-cut answer and those who take
a different view are simply mistaken.
137 

THE CONSERVATIVE POSITION
The central argument against abortion, put as a formal argument, would go something like this:
First premise: It is wrong to kill an innocent human being.
Second premise: A human fetus is an innocent human being.
Conclusion: Therefore it is wrong to kill a human fetus.
The usual liberal response is to deny the second premise of
this argument. So it is on whether the fetus is a human being
that the issue is joined, and the dispute about abortion is often
taken to be a dispute about when a human life begins.
On this issue the conservative position is difficult to shake.
The conservative points to the continuum between the fertilised
egg and child, and challenges the liberal to point to any stage
in this gradual process that marks a morally significant dividing
line. Unless there is such a line, the conservative says, we
must either upgrade the status of the earliest embryo to that
of the child, or downgrade the status of the child to that of
the embryo; but no one wants to allow children to be dispatched on the request of their parents, and so the only tenable
position is to grant the fetus the protection we now grant the
child.
Is it true that there is no morally significant dividing line
between fertilised egg and child? Those commonly suggested
are: birth, viability, quickening, and the onset of consciousness.
Let us consider these in turn.
Birth
Birth is the most visible possible dividing line, and the one that
would suit liberals best. It coincides to some extent with our
sympathies - we are less disturbed at the destruction of a fetus
we have never seen than at the death of a being we can all see,
hear and cuddle. But is this enough to make birth the line that
138 

decides whether a being may or may not be killed? The conservative can plausibly reply that the fetus/baby is the same
entity, whether inside or outside the womb, with the same
human features (whether we can see them or not) and the same
degree of awareness and capacity for feeling pain. A prematurely
born infant may well be less developed in these respects than a
fetus nearing the end of its normal term. It seems peculiar to
hold that we may not kill the premature infant, but may kill
the more developed fetus. The location of a being - inside or
outside the womb - should not make that rrfuch difference to
the wrongness of killing it.
Viability
If birth does not mark a crucial moral distinction, should we
push the line back to the time at which the fetus could survive
outside the womb? This overcomes one objection to taking birth
as the decisive point, for it treats the viable fetus on a par with
the infant, born prematurely, at the same stage of development.
Viability is where the United States Supreme Court drew the
line in Roe v. Wade. The Court held that the state has a legitimate
interest in protecting potential life, and this interest becomes
'compelling' at viability 'because the fetus then presumably has
the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb'.
Therefore statutes prohibiting abortion after viability would not,
the Court said, be unconstitutional. But the judges who wrote
the majority decision gave no indication why the mere capacity
to exist outside the womb should make such a difference to the
state's interest in protecting potential life. After all, if we talk,
as the Court does, of potential human life, then the nonviable
fetus is as much a potential adult human as the viable fetus. (I
shall return to this issue of potentiality shortly; but it is a different issue from the conservative argument we are now discussing, which claims that the fetus is a human being, and not
just a potential human being.)
139 

There is another important objection to making viability the
cut-off point. The point at which the fetus can survive outside
the mother's body varies according to the state of medical
technology. Thirty years ago it was generally accepted that a
baby born more than two months premature could not survive.
Now a six-month fetus - three months premature - can often
be pulled through, thanks to sophisticated medical techniques,
and fetuses born after as little as five and a half months of
gestation have survived. This threatens to undermine the Supreme Court's neat division of pregnancy into trimesters, with
the boundary of viability lying between the second and third
trimesters.
In the light of these medical developments, do we say that a
six-month-old fetus should not be aborted now, but could have
been aborted without wrongdoing thirty years ago? The same
comparison can also be made, not between the present and the
past, but between different places. A six-month-old fetus might
have a fair chance of survival if born in a city where the latest
medical techniques are used, but no chance at all if born in a
remote village in Chad or New Guinea. Suppose that for some
reason a woman, six months pregnant, was to fly from New
York to a New Guinea village and that, once she had arrived
in the village, there was no way she could return quickly to a
city with modern medical facilities. Are we to say that it would
have been wrong for her to have an abortion before she left
New York, but now that she is in the village she may go ahead?
The trip does not change the nature of the fetus, so why should
it remove its claim to life?
The liberal might reply that the fact that the fetus is totally
dependent on the mother for its survival means that it has no
right to life independent of her wishes. In other cases, however,
we do not hold that total dependence on another person means
that that person may decide whether one lives or dies. A newborn baby is totally dependent on its mother, if it happens to
140 

be born in an isolated area in which there is no other lactating
woman, nor the means for bottle feeding. An elderly woman
may be totally dependent on her son looking after her, and a
hiker who breaks her leg five days' walk from the nearest road
may die if her companion does not bring help. We do not think
that in these situations the mother may take the life qf her baby,
the son of his aged mother, or the hiker of her injured companion. So it is not plausible to suggest that the dependence of
the nonviable fetus on its mother gives her the right to kill it;
and if dependence does not justify making viability the dividing
line, it is hard to see what does.
Quickening
If neither birth nor viability marks a morally significant distinction, there is less still to be said for a third candidate,
quickening. Quickening is the time when the mother first feels
the fetus move, and in traditional Catholic theology, this was
thought to be the moment at which the fetus gained its soul.
If we accepted that view, we might think quickening important, since the soul is, on the Christian view, what marks
humans off from animals. But the idea that the soul enters
the fetus at quickening is an outmoded piece of superstition,
discarded now even by Catholic theologians. Putting aside
these religious doctrines makes quickening insignificant. It is
no more than the time when the fetus is first felt to move of
its own accord; the fetus is alive before this moment, and
ultrasound studies have shown that fetuses do in fact start
moving as early as six weeks after fertilization, long before
they can be felt to move. In any case, the capacity for physical
motion - or the lack of it - has nothing to do with the
seriousness of one's claim for continued life. We do not see
the lack of such a capacity as negating the claims of paralysed
people to go on living.
141 

Consciousness
Movement might be thought to be indirectly of moral significance, in so far as it is an indication of some form of awareness
- and as we have already seen, consciousness, and the capacity
to feel pleasure or pain, are of real moral significance. Despite
this, neither side in the abortion debate has made much mention of the development of consciousness in the fetus. Those
opposed to abortion may show films about the 'silent scream'
of the fetus when aborted, but the intention behind such films
is merely to stir the emotions of the uncommitted. Opponents
of abortion really want to uphold the right to life of the human
being from conception, irrespective of whether it is conscious
or not. For those in favour of abortion, to appeal to the absence
of a capacity for consciousness has seemed a risky strategy.
On the basis of the studies showing that movement takes place
as early as six weeks after fertilization, coupled with other
studies that have found some brain activity as early as the
seventh week, it has been suggested that the fetus could be
capable of feeling pain at this early stage of pregnancy. That
possibility has made liberals very wary of appealing to the
onset of consciousness as a point at which the fetus has a
right to life. We shall return to the issue of consciousness in
the fetus later in this chapter, because it is relevant to the
issue of embryo and fetal experimentation. We will also then
consider an earlier marker that could be relevant to embryo
experimentation, but not to the abortion debate. As far as
abortion is concerned, the discussion up to now has shown
that the liberal search for a morally crucial dividing line between the newborn baby and the fetus has failed to yield any
event or stage of development that can bear the weight of
separating those with a right to life from those who lack such
a right, in a way that clearly shows fetuses to be in the latter
category at the stage of development when most abortions
take place. The conservative is on solid ground in insisting
142 

that the development from the embryo to the infant is a gradual
process.
SOME LIBERAL ARGUMENTS
Some liberals do not challenge the conservative claim that the
fetus is an innocent human being, but argue that abortion is
nonetheless permissible. I shall consider three arguments for
this view.
The Consequences of Restrictive Laws
The first argument is that laws prohibiting abortion do not stop
abortions, but merely drive them underground. Women who
want to have abortions are often desperate. They will go to
backyard abortionists or try folk remedies. Abortion performed
by a qualified medical practitioner is as safe as any medical
operation, but attempts to procure abortions by unqualified people often result in serious medical complications and sometimes
death. Thus the effect of prohibiting abortion is not so much to
reduce the number of abortions performed as to increase the
difficulties and dangers for women with unwanted pregnancies.
This argument has been influential in gaining support for
more liberal abortion laws. It was accepted by the Canadian
Royal Commission on the Status of Women, which concluded
that: 'A law that has more bad effects than good ones is a bad
law.. . As long as it exists in its present form thousands of
women will break it.'
The main point to note about this argument is that it is an
argument against laws prohibiting abortion, and not an argument against the view that abortion is wrong. This is an important distinction, often overlooked in the abortion debate.
The present argument well illustrates the distinction, because
one could quite consistently accept it and advocate that the law
should allow abortion on request, while at the same time de143 

ciding oneself - if one were pregnant - or counselling another
w ho was pregnant, that it would be wrong to have an abortion.
It is a mistake to assume that the law should always enforce
morality. It may be that, as alleged in the case of abortion,
attempts to enforce right conduct lead to consequences no one
wants, and no decrease in wrong-doing; or it may be that, as
is proposed by the next argument we shall consider, there is an
area of private ethics with which the law ought not to interfere.
So this first argument is an argument about abortion law, not
about the ethics of abortion. Even within those limits, however,
it is open to challenge, for it fails to meet the conservative claim
that abortion is the deliberate killing of an innocent human
being, and in the same ethical category as murder. Those who
take this view of abortion will not rest content with the assertion
that restrictive abortion laws do no more than drive women to
backyard abortionists. They will insist that this situation can be
changed, and the law properly enforced. They may also suggest
measures to make pregnancy easier to accept for those women
w ho become pregnant against their wishes. This is a perfectly
reasonable response, given the initial ethical judgment against
abortion, and for this reason the first argument does not succeed
in avoiding the ethical issue.
Not the Law's Business?
The second argument is again an argument about abortion laws
rather than the ethics of abortion. It uses the view that, as the
report of a British government committee inquiring into laws
about homosexuality and prostitution put it: 'There must remain a realm of private morality and immorality that is, in brief
and crude terms, not the law's business.' This view is widely
accepted among liberal thinkers, and can be traced back to John
Stuart Mill's On Liberty. The'one very simple principle' of this
work is, in Mill's words:
144 

That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is
to prevent harm to others... He cannot rightfully be compelled
to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because
it will make him happier, because in the opinions of others, to
do so would be wise or even right.
Mill's view is often and properly quoted in support of the repeal
of laws that create 'victimless crimes' - like laws prohibiting
homosexual relations between consenting adults, the use of
marijuana and other drugs, prostitution, gambling and so on.
Abortion is often included in this list, for example by the criminologist Edwin Schur in his book Crimes Without Victims. Those
who consider abortion a victimless crime say that, while everyone is entitled to hold and act on his or her own view about
the morality of abortion, no section of the community should
try to force others to adhere to its own particular view. In a
pluralist society, we should tolerate others with different moral
views and leave the decision to have an abortion up to the
woman concerned.
The fallacy involved in numbering abortion among the victimless crimes should be obvious. The dispute about abortion
is, largely, a dispute about whether or not abortion does have
a 'victim'. Opponents of abortion maintain that the victim of
abortion is the fetus. Those not opposed to abortion may deny
that the fetus counts as a victim in any serious way. They might,
for instance, say that a being cannot be a victim unless it has
interests that are violated, and the fetus has no interests. But
however this dispute may go, one cannot simply ignore it on
the grounds that people should not attempt to force others to
follow their own moral views. My view that what Hitler did to
the Jews is wrong is a moral view, and if there were any prospect
of a revival of Nazism I would certainly do my best to force
others not to act contrary to this view. Mill's principle is defensible only if it is restricted, as Mill restricted it, to acts that do
not harm others. To use the principle as a means of avoiding
145 

the difficulties of resolving the ethical dispute over abortion is
to take it for granted that abortion does not harm an 'other' -
which is precisely the point that needs to be proven before we
can legitimately apply the principle to the case of abortion.
A Feminist Argument
The last of the three arguments that seek to justify abortion
without denying that the fetus is an innocent human being is
that a woman has a right to choose what happens to her own
body. This argument became prominent with the rise of the
women's liberation movement and has been elaborated by
American philosophers sympathetic to feminism. An influential
argument has been presented by Judith Jarvis Thomson by
means of an ingenious analogy. Imagine, she says, that you
wake up one morning and find yourself in a hospital bed, somehow connected to an unconscious man in an adjacent bed. You
are told that this man is a famous violinist with kidney disease.
The only way he can survive is for his circulatory system to be
plugged into the system of someone else with the same blood
type, and you are the only person whose blood is suitable. So
a society of music lovers kidnapped you, had the connecting
operation performed, and there you are. Since you are now in
a reputable hospital you could, if you choose, order a doctor to
disconnect you from the violinist; but the violinist will then
certainly die. On the other hand, if you remain connected for
only (only?) nine months, the violinist will have recovered and
you can be unplugged without endangering him.
Thomson believes that if you found yourself in this unexpected predicament you would not be morally required to allow
the violinist to use your kidneys for nine months. It might be
generous or kind of you to do so, but to say this is, Thomson
claims, quite different from saying that you would be doing
wrong if you did not do it.
146 

Note that Thomson's conclusion does not depend on denying
that the violinist is an innocent human being, with the same
right to life as any other innocent human being. On the contrary,
Thomson affirms that the violinist does have a right to life -
but to have a right to life does not, she says, entail a right to
the use of another's body, even if without that use one will die.
The parallel with pregnancy, especially pregnancy due to rape
should be obvious. A woman pregnant through rape finds herself, through no choice of her own, linked to a fetus in much
the same way as the person is linked to the violinist. True, a
pregnant woman does not normally have to spend nine months
in bed, but opponents of abortion would not regard this as a
sufficient justification for abortion. Giving up a newborn baby
for adoption might be more difficult, psychologically, than parting from the violinist at the end of his illness; but this in itself
does not seem a sufficient reason for killing the fetus. Accepting
for the sake of the argument that the fetus does count as a fullyfledged human being, having an abortion when the fetus is not
viable has the same moral significance as unplugging oneself
from the violinist. So if we agree with Thomson that it would
not be wrong to unplug oneself from the violinist, we must also
accept that, whatever the status of the fetus, abortion is not
wrong - at least not when the pregnancy results from rape.
Thomson's argument can probably be extended beyond cases
of rape. Suppose that you found yourself connected to the violinist, not because you were kidnapped by music lovers, but
because you had intended to enter the hospital to visit a sick
friend, and when you got into the elevator, you carelessly
pressed the wrong button, and ended up in a section of the
hospital normally visited only by those who have volunteered
to be connected to patients who would not otherwise survive.
A team of doctors, waiting for the next volunteer, assumed you
were it, jabbed you with an anaesthetic, and connected you. If
Thomson's argument was sound in the kidnap case it is
probably sound here too, since nine months unwillingly sup147 

porting another is a high price to pay for ignorance or carelessness. In this way the argument might apply beyond rape
cases to the much larger number of women who become pregnant through ignorance, carelessness, or contraceptive failure.
But is the argument sound? The short answer is this: It is
sound if the particular theory of rights that lies behind it is
sound; and it is unsound if that theory of rights is unsound.
The theory of rights in question can be illustrated by another
of Thomson's fanciful examples: suppose I am desperately ill
and the only thing that can save my life is the touch of my
favourite film star's cool hand on my fevered brow. Well, Thomson says, even though I have a right to life, this does not mean
that I have a right to force the film star to come to me, or that
he is under any, moral obligation to fly over and save me -
although it would be frightfully nice of him to do so. Thus
Thomson does not accept that we are always obliged to take
the best course of action, all things considered, or to do what
has the best consequences. She accepts, instead, a system of
rights and obligations that allows us to justify our actions independently of their consequences.
I shall say more about this conception of rights in Chapter 8.
At this stage it is enough to notice that a utilitarian would reject
this theory of rights, and would reject Thomson's judgment in
the case of the violinist. The utilitarian would hold that, however
outraged I may be at having been kidnapped, if the consequences of disconnecting myself from the violinist are, on balance, and taking into account the interests of everyone affected,
worse than the consequences of remaining connected, I ought
to remain connected. This does not necessarily mean that utilitarians would regard a woman who disconnected herself as
wicked or deserving of blame. They might recognize that she
has been placed in an extraordinarily difficult situation, one in
which to do what is right involves a considerable sacrifice. They
might even grant that most people in this situation would follow
148 

self-interest rather than do the right thing. Nevertheless, they
would hold that to disconnect oneself is wrong.
In rejecting Thomson's theory of rights, and with it her judgment in the case of the violinist, the utilitarian would also be
rejecting her argument for abortion. Thomson claimed that her
argument justified abortion even if we allowed the life of the
fetus to count as heavily as the life of a normal person. The
utilitarian would say that it would be wrong to refuse to sustain
a person's life for nine months, if that was the only way the
person could survive. Therefore if the life of the fetus is given
the same weight as the life of a normal person, the utilitarian
would say that it would be wrong to refuse to carry the fetus
until it can survive outside the womb.
This concludes our discussion of the usual liberal replies to
the conservative argument against abortion. We have seen that
liberals have failed to establish a morally significant dividing
line between the newborn baby and the fetus, and their arguments - with the possible exception of Thomson's argument if
her theory of rights can be defended - also fail to justify abortion
in ways that do not challenge the conservative claim that the
fetus is an innocent human being. Nevertheless, it would be
premature for conservatives to assume that their case against
abortion is sound. It is now time to bring into this debate some
more general conclusions about the value of life.
THE VALUE OF FETAL LIFE
Let us go back to the beginning. The central argument against
abortion from which we started was:
First premise: It is wrong to kill an innocent human being.
Second premise: A human fetus is an innocent human being.
Conclusion: Therefore it is wrong to kill a human fetus.
The first set of replies we considered accepted the first premise
of this argument but objected to the second. The second set of
149 

replies rejected neither premise, but objected to drawing the
conclusion from these premises (or objected to the further conclusion that abortion should be prohibited by law). None of the
replies questioned the first premise of the argument. Given the
widespread acceptance of the doctrine of the sanctity of human
life, this is not surprising; but the discussion of this doctrine in
the preceding chapters shows that this premise is less secure
than many people think.
The weakness of the first premise of the conservative argument is that it relies on our acceptance of the special status of
human life. We have seen that 'human' is a term that straddles
two distinct notions: being a member of the species Homo sapiens, and being a person. Once the term is dissected in this way,
the weakness of the conservative's first premise becomes apparent. If 'human' is taken as equivalent to 'person', the second
premise of the argument, which asserts that the fetus is a human
being, is clearly false; for one cannot plausibly argue that a fetus
is either rational or self-conscious. If, on the other hand, 'human' is taken to mean no more than 'member of the species
Homo sapiens', then the conservative defence of the life of the
fetus is based on a characteristic lacking moral significance and
so the first premise is false. The point should by now be familiar:
whether a being is or is not a member of our species is, in itself
no more relevant to the wrongness of killing it than whether it
is or is not a member of our race. The belief that mere membership of our species, irrespective of other characteristics,
makes a great difference to the wrongness of killing a being is
a legacy of religious doctrines that even those opposed to abortion hesitate to bring into the debate.
Recognising this simple point transforms the abortion issue.
We can now look at the fetus for what it is - the actual characteristics it possesses - and can value its life on the same scale
as the lives of beings with similar characteristics who are not
members of our species. It now becomes apparent that the 'Pro
Life' or 'Right to Life' movement is misnamed. Far from having
150 

concern for all life, or a scale of concern impartially based on
the nature of the life in question, those who protest against
abortion but dine regularly on the bodies of chickens, pigs and
calves, show only a biased concern for the lives of members of
our own species. For on any fair comparison of morally relevant
characteristics, like rationality, self-consciousness, awareness,
autonomy, pleasure and pain, and so on, the calf, the pig and
the much derided chicken come out well ahead of the fetus at
any stage of pregnancy - while if we make the comparison with
a fetus of less than three months, a fish would show more signs
of consciousness.
My suggestion, then, is that we accord the life of a fetus no
greater value than the life of a nonhuman animal at a similar
level of rationality, self-consciousness, awareness, capacity to
feel, etc. Since no fetus is a person, no fetus has the same claim
to life as a person. We have yet to consider at what point the
fetus is likely to become capable of feeling pain. For now it will
be enough to say that until that capacity exists, an abortion
terminates an existence that is of no "intrinsic" value at all.
Afterwards, when the fetus may be conscious, though not selfconscious, abortion should not be taken lightly (if a woman
ever does take abortion lightly). But a woman's serious interests
would normally override the rudimentary interests even of a
conscious fetus. Indeed, even an abortion late in pregnancy for
the most trivial reasons is hard to condemn unless we also
condemn the slaughter of far more developed forms of life for
the taste of their flesh.
The comparison between the fetus and other animals leads
us to one more point. Where the balance of conflicting interests
does make it necessary to kill a sentient creature, it is important
that the killing be done as painlessly as possible. In the case of
nonhuman animals the importance of humane killing is widely
accepted; oddly, in the case of abortion little attention is paid
to it. This is not because abortion is known to kill the fetus
swiftly and humanely. Late abortions - which are the very ones
151 

in which the fetus may be able to suffer - are sometimes performed by injecting a salt solution into the amniotic sac that
surrounds the fetus. It has been claimed that the effect of this
is to cause the fetus to have convulsions and die between one
and three hours later. Afterwards the dead fetus is expelled from
the womb. If there are grounds for thinking that a method of
abortion causes the fetus to suffer, that method should be
avoided.
THE FETUS AS POTENTIAL LIFE
One likely objection to the argument I have offered in the preceding section is that it takes into account only the actual characteristics of the fetus, and not its potential characteristics. On
the basis of its actual characteristics, some opponents of abortion
will admit, the fetus compares unfavourably with many nonhuman animals; it is when we consider its potential to become
a mature human being that membership of the species Homo
sapiens becomes important, and the fetus far surpasses any
chicken, pig or calf.
Up to this point I have not raised the question of the potential
of the fetus because I thought it best to concentrate on the central
argument against abortion; but it is true that a different argument, based on the potential of the fetus, can be mounted. Now
is the time to look at this other argument. We can state it as
follows:
First premise: It is wrong to kill a potential human being.
Second premise: A human fetus is a potential human being.
Conclusion: Therefore it is wrong to kill a human fetus.
The second premise of this argument is stronger than the
second premise of the preceding argument. Whereas it is problematic whether a fetus actually is a human being - it depends
on what we mean by the term - it cannot be denied that the
152 

fetus is a potential human being. This is true whether by 'human
being' we mean 'member of the species Homo sapiens' or a
rational and self-conscious being, a person. The strong second
premise of the new argument is, however, purchased at the cost
of a weaker first premise, for the wrongness of killing a potential
human being - even a potential person - is more open to challenge than the wrongness of killing an actual human being.
It is of course true that the potential rationality, selfconsciousness and so on of a fetal Homo sapiens surpasses that
of a cow or pig; but it does not follow that the fetus has a
stronger claim to life. There is no rule that says that a potential
X has the same value as an X, or has all the rights of an X.
There are many examples that show just the contrary. To pull
out a sprouting acorn is not the same as cutting down a venerable oak. To drop a live chicken into a pot of boiling water
would be much worse than doing the same to an egg. Prince
Charles is a potential King of England, but he does not now
have the rights of a king.
In the absence of any general inference from 'A is a potential
X' to 'A has the rights of an X', we should not accept that a
potential person should have the rights of a person, unless we
can be given some specific reason why this should hold in this
particular case. But what could that reason be? This question
becomes especially pertinent if we recall the grounds on which,
in the previous chapter, it was suggested that the life of a person
merits greater protection than the life of a being who is not a
person. These reasons - from the indirect classical utilitarian
concern with not arousing in others the fear that they may be
the next killed, the weight given by the preference utilitarian
to a person's desires, Tooley's link between a right to life and
the capacity to see oneself as a continuing mental subject, and
the principle of respect for autonomy - are all based on the fact
that persons see themselves as distinct entities with a past and
future. They do not apply to those who are not now and never
153 

have been capable of seeing themselves in this way. If these are
the grounds for not killing persons, the mere potential for becoming a person does not count against killing.
It might be said that this reply misunderstands the relevance
of the potential of the human fetus, and that this potential is
important, not because it creates in the fetus a right or claim to
life, but because anyone who kills a human fetus deprives the
world of a future rational and self-conscious being. If rational
and self-conscious beings are intrinsically valuable, to kill a
human fetus is to deprive the world of something intrinsically
valuable, and so wrong. The chief problem with this as an argument against abortion - apart from the difficulty of establishing that rational and self-conscious beings are of intrinsic
value - is that it does not stand up as a reason for objecting to
all abortions, or even to abortions carried out merely because
the pregnancy is inconveniently timed. Moreover the argument
leads us to condemn practices other than abortion that most
anti-abortionists accept.
The claim that rational and self-conscious beings are intrinsically valuable is not a reason for objecting to all abortions
because not all abortions deprive the world of a rational and
self-conscious being. Suppose a woman has been planning to
join a mountain-climbing expedition in June, and in January
she learns that she is two months pregnant. She has no children
at present, and firmly intends to have a child within a year or
two. The pregnancy is unwanted only because it is inconveniently timed. Opponents of abortion would presumably think
an abortion in these circumstances particularly outrageous, for
neither the life nor the health of the mother is at stake - only
the enjoyment she gets from climbing mountains. Yet if abortion
is wrong only because it deprives the world of a future person,
this abortion is not wrong; it does no more than delay the entry
of a person into the world.
On the other hand this argument against abortion does lead
us to condemn practices that reduce the future human popu154 

lation: contraception, whether by 'artificial' means or by 'natural' means such as abstinence on days when the woman is
likely to be fertile; and also celibacy. This argument has, in fact,
all the difficulties of the 'total' form of utilitarianism, discussed
in the previous two chapters, and it does not provide any reason
for thinking abortion worse than any other means of population
control. If the world is already overpopulated, the argument
provides no reason at all against abortion.
Is there any other significance in the fact that the fetus is a
potential person? If there is I have no idea what it could be. In
writings against abortion we often find reference to the fact that
each human fetus is unique. Paul Ramsey, a former Professor
of Religion at Princeton University, has said that modern genetics, by teaching us that the first fusion of sperm and ovum
creates a 'never-to-be-repeated' informational speck, seems to
lead us to the conclusion that 'all destruction of fetal life should
be classified as murder'. But why should this fact lead us to this
conclusion? A canine fetus is also, no doubt, genetically unique.
Does this mean that it is as wrong to abort a dog as a human?
When identical twins are conceived, the genetic information is
repeated. Would Ramsey therefore think it permissible to abort
one of a pair of identical twins? The children that my wife and
I would produce if we did not use contraceptives would be
genetically unique. Does the fact that it is still indeterminate
precisely what genetically unique character those children
would have make the use of contraceptives less evil than abortion? Why should it? And if it does could the looming prospect
of successful cloning - a technique in which the cells of one
individual are used to reproduce a fetus that is a genetic carbon
copy of the original - diminish the seriousness of abortion?
Suppose the woman who wants to go mountain climbing were
able to have her abortion, take a cell from the aborted fetus and
then reimplant that cell in her womb so that an exact genetic
replica of the aborted fetus would develop - the only difference
being that the pregnancy would now come to term six months
155 

later, and thus she could still join the expedition. Would that
make the abortion acceptable? I doubt that many opponents of
abortion would think so.
THE STATUS OF THE EMBRYO IN THE LABORATORY
It is now time to turn to the debate about experimenting on
early human embryos, kept alive in a special fluid, outside the
human body. This is a relatively new debate, because the possibility of keeping an embryo alive outside the body is new; but
in many respects it goes over the same ground as the abortion
debate. Although one central argument for abortion - the claim
that a woman has the right to control her own body - is not
directly applicable in the newer context, the argument against
embryo experimentation relies on one of the two claims we
have already examined: either that the embryo is entitled to
protection because it is a human being, or that the embryo is
entitled to protection because it is a potential human being.
One might therefore think that the case against embryo experimentation is stronger than the case for abortion. For one
argument in favour of abortion does not apply, while the major
arguments against abortion do. In fact, however, the two arguments against abortion do not apply as straightforwardly as
one might imagine to the embryo in the laboratory.
First, is the embryo already a human being? We have already
seen that claims for a right to life should not be based on species
membership, so the fact that the embryo is of the species Homo
sapiens does not show that the embryo is a human being in any
morally relevant sense. And if the fetus is not a person, it is
even more apparent that the embryo cannot be one. But there
is a further interesting point to be made against the claim that
the early embryo is a human being: human beings are individuals, and the early embryo is not even an individual. At any
time up to about 14 days after fertilisation - and that is longer
than human embryos have so far been kept alive outside the
156 

body - the embryo can split into two or more genetically identical embryos. This happens naturally and leads to the formation
of identical twins. When we have an embryo prior to this point,
we cannot be sure if what we are looking at is the precursor of
one or two individuals.
This poses a problem for those who stress the continuity of
our existence from conception to adulthood. Suppose we have
an embryo in a dish on a laboratory bench. If we think of this
embryo as the first stage of an individual human being, we might
call it Mary. But now suppose the embryo divides into two
identical embryos. Is one of them still Mary, and the other Jane?
If so, which one is Mary? There is nothing to distinguish the
two, no way of saying that the one we call Jane split off from
the one we call Mary, rather than vice versa. So should we say
that Mary is no longer with us, and instead we have Jane and
Helen? But what happened to Mary? Did she die? Should we
grieve for her? There is something absurd about these speculations. The absurdity stems from thinking of the embryo as an
individual at a time at which it is only a cluster of cells. So,
until the possibility of twinning is past, it is even more difficult
to maintain that the embryo is a human being, in any morally
significant sense, than it is to maintain that the fetus is a human
being in a morally significant sense. This provides some basis
for the laws and guidelines in Britain and various other countries
that allow experimentation on the embryo up to 14 days after
fertilisation. But for reasons already given, and others that we
are about to discuss, this is still an unnecessarily restrictive limit.
What of the argument from potential? Can the familiar claims
about the potential of the embryo in the uterus be applied to
the embryo in a dish in the laboratory? Before Robert Edwards
began the research that led to the IVF procedure, no-one had
observed a viable human embryo prior to the stage at which it
implants in the wall of the uterus. In the normal process of
reproduction inside the body, the embryo, or 'pre-embryo' as
it is now sometimes called, remains unattached for the first
157 

seven to fourteen days. As long as such embryos existed only
inside the woman's body, there was no way of observing them
during that period. The very existence of the embryo could not
be established until after implantation. Under these circumstances, once the existence of an embryo was known, that embryo had a good chance of becoming a person, unless its
development was deliberately interrupted. The probability of
such an embryo becoming a person was therefore very much
greater than the probability of an egg in a fertile woman uniting
with sperm from that woman's partner and leading to a child.
There was also, in those pre-IVF days, a further important
distinction between the embryo and the egg and sperm.
Whereas the embryo inside the female body has some definite
chance (we shall consider later how great a chance) of developing into a child unless a deliberate human act interrupts its
growth, the egg and sperm can only develop into a child if there
is a deliberate human act. So in the one case, all that is needed
for the embryo to have a prospect of realising its potential is for
those involved to refrain from stopping it; in the other case, they
have to carry out a positive act. The development of the embryo
inside the female body can therefore be seen as a mere unfolding
of a potential that is inherent in it. (Admittedly, this is an oversimplification, for it takes no account of the positive acts involved in childbirth; but it is close enough.) The development
of the separated egg and sperm is more difficult to regard in this
way, because no further development will take place unless the
couple have sexual intercourse or use artificial insemination.
Now consider what has happened as a result of the success
of IVF. The procedure involves removing one or more eggs from
a woman's ovary, placing them in the appropriate fluid in a
glass dish, and then adding sperm to the dish. In the more
proficient laboratories, this leads to fertilisation in about 80%
of the eggs thus treated. The embryo can then be kept in the
dish for two to three days, while it grows and divides into two,
four, and then eight cells. At about this stage the embryo is
158 

usually transferred to a woman's uterus. Although the transfer
itself is a simple procedure, it is after the transfer that things are
most likely to go wrong: for reasons that are not fully understood, with even the most successful IVF teams, the probability
of a given embryo that has been transferred to the uterus actually
implanting there, and leading to a continuing pregnancy, is
always less than 20%, and generally no more than 10%. In
summary, then, before the advent of IVF, in every instance in
which we knew of the existence of a normal human embryo,
it would have been true to say of that embryo that, unless it
was deliberately interfered with, it would most likely develop
into a person. The process of IVF, however, leads to the creation
of embryos that cannot develop into a person unless there is
some deliberate human act (the transfer to the uterus) and that
even then, in the best of circumstances, will most likely not
develop into a person.
The upshot of all this is that IVF has reduced the difference
between what can be said about the embryo, and what can be
said about the egg and sperm, when still separate, but considered
as a pair. Before IVF, any normal human embryo known to us
had a far greater chance of becoming a child than any egg plus
sperm prior to fertilisation taking place. But with IVF, there is
a much more modest difference in the probability of a child
resulting from a 2-cell embryo in a glass dish, and the probability
of a child resulting from an egg and some sperm in a glass dish.
To be specific, if we assume that the laboratory's fertilisation
rate is 80% and its rate of pregnancy per embryo transferred is
10%, then the probability of a child resulting from a given
embryo is 10%, and the probability of a child resulting from an
egg that has been placed in a fluid to which sperm has been
added is 8%. So if the embryo is a potential person, why are
not the egg-and-^perm, considered jointly, also a potential person? Yet no member of the pro-life movement wants to rescue
eggs and sperm in order to save the lives of the people that they
have the potential to become.

Consider the following, not too improbable scenario. In the
IVF laboratory, a woman's egg has been obtained. It sits in one
dish on the bench. The sperm from her partner sits in an adjacent
dish, ready to be mixed into the solution containing the egg.
Then some bad news arrives: the woman is bleeding from the
uterus, and will not be in a suitable condition to receive an
embryo for at least a month. There is therefore no point in going
ahead with the procedure. A laboratory assistant is told to dispose of the egg and sperm. She does so by tipping them down
the sink. So far, so good; but a few hours later, when the
assistant returns to prepare the laboratory for the next procedure, she notices that the sink is blocked. The egg and its fluid
are still there, in the bottom of the sink. She is about to clear
the blockage, when she realizes that the sperm has been tipped
into the sink too. Quite possibly, the egg has been fertilised!
Now what is she to do? Those who draw a sharp distinction
between the egg-and-sperm and the embryo must hold that,
while the assistant was quite entitled to pour the egg and sperm
down the sink, it would be wrong to clear the blockage now.
This is difficult to accept. Potentiality seems not to be such an
all-or-nothing concept; the difference between the egg-andsperm and the embryo is one of degree, related to the probability
of development into a person.
Traditional defenders of the right to life of the embryo have
been reluctant to introduce degrees of potential into the debate,
because once the notion is accepted, it seems undeniable that
the early embryo is less of a potential person than the later
embryo or the fetus. This could easily be understood as leading
to the conclusion that the prohibition against destroying the
early embryo is less stringent than the prohibition against destroying the later embryo or fetus. Nevertheless, some defenders
of the argument from potential have invoked probability.
Among these has been the Roman Catholic theologian John
Noonan:
160 

As life itself is a matter of probabilities, as most moral reasoning
is an estimate of probabilities, so it seems in accord with the
structure of reality and the nature of moral thought to found a
moral judgment on the change in probabilities at conception...
Would the argument be different if only one out of ten children
conceived came to term? Of course this argument would be
different. This argument is an appeal to probabilities that actually
exist, not to any and all states of affairs which may be imagined
... If a spermatozoon is destroyed, one destroys a being which
had a chance of far less than 1 in 200 million of developing into
a reasoning being, possessed of the genetic code, a heart and
other organs, and capable of pain. If a fetus is destroyed, one
destroys a being already possessed of the genetic code, organs
and sensitivity to pain, and one which had an 80 per cent chance
of developing further into a baby outside the womb who, in
time, would reason.
The article from which this quotation is taken has been influential in the abortion debate, and has often been quoted and
reprinted by those opposed to abortion, but the development
of our understanding of the reproductive process has made
Noonan's position untenable. The initial difficulty is that Noonan's figures for embryo survival even in the uterus are no longer
regarded as accurate. At the time Noonan wrote, the estimate
of pregnancy loss was based on clinical recognition of pregnancies at six to eight weeks after fertilisation. At this stage, the
chance of losing the pregnancy through spontaneous abortion
is about 15%. Recent technical advances allowing earlier recognition of pregnancy, however, provide startlingly different
figures. If pregnancy is diagnosed before implantation (within
14 days of fertilisation) the probability of a birth resulting is 25
to 30%. Post-implantation this increases initially to 46 to 60%,
and it is not until six weeks gestation that the chance of birth
occurring increases to 85 to 90%.
Noonan claimed that his argument is 'an appeal to probabilities that actually exist, not to any and all states of affairs which
may be imagined'. But once we substitute the real probabilities
161 

of embryos, at various stages of their existence, becoming persons, Noonan's argument no longer supports the moment of
fertilisation as the time at which the embryo gains a significantly
different moral status. Indeed, if we were to require an 80%
probability of further development into a baby - the figure
Noonan himself mentions - we would have to wait until nearly
six weeks after fertilisation before the embryo would have the
significance Noonan wants to claim for it.
At one point in his argument Noonan refers to the number
of sperm involved in a male ejaculation, and says that there is
only one chance in 200,000,000 of a sperm becoming part of
a living being. This focus on the sperm rather than the egg is a
curious instance of male bias, but even if we let that pass, new
technology provides still one more difficulty for the argument.
There now exists a means of overcoming male infertility caused
by a low sperm count. The egg is removed as in the normal in
vitro procedure; but instead of adding a drop of seminal fluid
to the dish with the egg, a single sperm is picked up with a fine
needle and micro-injected under the outer layer of the egg. So
if we compare the probability of the embryo becoming a person
with the probability of the egg, together with the single sperm
that has been picked up by the needle and is about to be microinjected into the egg, becoming a person, we will be unable to
find any sharp distinction between the two. Does that mean
that it would be wrong to stop the procedure, once the sperm
has been picked up? Noonan's argument from probabilities
would seem to commit him either to this implausible claim, or
to accepting that we may destroy human embryos. This procedure also undermines Ramsey's claim about the importance
of the unique genetic blueprint - that '"never-to-be-repeated"
informational speck' having been determined in the case of the
embryo but not in the case of the egg and sperm. For that too
is here determined before fertilisation.
In this section I have tried to show how the special circum162 

stances of the embryo in the laboratory affect the application
of the arguments discussed elsewhere in this chapter about the
status of the embryo or fetus. I have not attempted to cover all
aspects of in vitro fertilisation and embryo experimentation. To
do that it would be necessary to investigate several other issues,
including the appropriateness of allocating scarce medical resources to this area at a time when the world has a serious
problem of overpopulation, and the speculation that the new
techniques will be misused to produce children 'made-to order',
either at the behest of parents or, worse still, of some mad
dictator. To cover these important but disparate matters would
take us too far from the main themes of this book. Brief mention
must, however, be made of one other aspect of embryo experimentation: the role of the couple from whose gametes the
embryo has developed.
Feminists have played a valuable role in pointing out how
vulnerable a couple may be to pressure from the medical team
to donate an embryo for research purposes. They may be desperate for a child. The IVF team represent their last hope of
achieving this goal. They know that there are many other couples seeking treatment. All this means that they are likely to be
prepared to go to great lengths in order to please the medical
team. When they are asked to donate eggs or embryos, can they
really make a free choice? Only, I think, if it is quite clear that
their answer will not affect their IVF treatment in any way.
Wherever experimentation on embryos is carried out, there is
a need to develop safeguards and forms of oversight to ensure
that this is always the case.
MAKING USE OF THE FETUS
The prospects of using human fetuses for medical purposes has
created a further controversial issue related to abortion. Research carried out specifically on fetuses has led to the hope of
163 

finding cures for many serious illnesses by the transplantation
of tissue or cells from the fetus. Compared with adult tissue,
fetal tissue appears to grow better after transplantation, and to
be less likely to be rejected by the patient. The example that
has received the most publicity to date is Parkinson's disease,
but the use of fetal tissue has also been suggested in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and diabetes; and fetal transplants have been used to save the life of
another fetus, in a case in which a 30 week old fetus, in utero,
suffering from a fatal immune system disorder was given fetal
cells from aborted fetuses.
Do fetuses have rights or interests that may be violated or
harmed by using them for these purposes? I have already argued
that the fetus has no right to, nor strictly speaking even an
interest in, life. But we have seen that, in the case of animals,
to say that a being has no right to life does not mean that the
being has no rights or interests at all. If the fetus is capable of
feeling pain, then, like animals, the fetus has an interest in not
suffering pain, and that interest should be given equal consideration with the similar interests of any other being. It is easy
to imagine that keeping a fetus alive after an abortion in order
to preserve the tissue of the fetus in the best possible condition
could cause pain and suffering to a fetus capable of feeling pain.
So we must now return to a more detailed investigation of a
topic touched upon earlier in this chapter: When does the fetus
become conscious?
Fortunately it is now possible to give a reasonably definite
answer to this question. The part of the brain associated with
sensations of pain, and more generally with consciousness, is
the cerebral cortex. Until 18 weeks of gestation, the cerebral
cortex is not sufficiently developed for synaptic connections to
take place within it - in other words, the signals that give rise
to pain in an adult are not being received. Between 18 and 25
weeks, the brain of the fetus reaches a stage at which there is
some nerve transmission in those parts associated with con164 

sciousness. Even then, however, the fetus appears to be in a
persistent state of sleep, and therefore may not be able to perceive pain. The fetus begins to 'wake up'at a gestational age of
around 30 weeks. This is, of course, well beyond the stage of
viability, and a 'fetus' that was alive and outside the womb at
this stage would be a premature baby, and not a fetus at all.
In order to give the fetus the benefit of the doubt, it would
be reasonable to take the earliest possible time at which the
fetus might be able to feel anything as the boundary after which
the fetus should be protected. Thus we should disregard the
uncertain evidence about wakefulness, and take as a more definite line, the time at which the brain is physically capable of
receiving signals necessary for awareness. This suggests a
boundary at 18 weeks of gestation. Prior to that time, there is
no good basis for believing that the fetus needs protection from
harmful research, because the fetus cannot be harmed. After
that time, the fetus does need protection from harm, on the
same basis as sentient, but not self-conscious, nonhuman animals need it.
There is, however, one qualification that must be added to
this statement. While the fetus prior to 18 weeks may, strictly
speaking, be unable to be harmed, if the fetus is allowed to
develop into a child, the future child could be very seriously
harmed by an experiment that caused the child to be born in
a disabled state. Therefore research that allows the fetus to survive beyond 18 weeks does not come under the permissive rule
suggested in the previous paragraph.
In discussions of the use of fetal tissue there is often mention
of the risk of 'complicity' in the immoral act of abortion. Those
wishing to defend the use of fetal tissue therefore go to great
lengths in order to show that the use of fetal tissue can be kept
entirely separate from the decision to carry out the abortion,
and so does not serve to 'legitimise' abortions. For the same
reason, many countries now have, or are developing, laws or
guidelines for the use of fetal tissue from induced abortions,
165 

and many of these laws or guidelines are drawn up on the basis
of the assumption, implicit or explicit, that it is important to
separate the decision for the abortion from the use of the fetal
tissue, lest the use of fetal tissue serve to increase the incidence
of abortions. There may be, for example, a requirement that the
donation has to be an entirely anonymous one. This prevents
a woman having an abortion in order to donate tissue that might
save the life of a relative, perhaps one of her existing children.
It is possible that the motivation for such requirements is to
protect the woman from pressure to have an abortion. Whether
that is a valid ground for requiring anonymity is something I
shall consider shortly. Here I wish only to point out that if it is
the premise that abortion is immoral that supplies the motive
for seeking to prevent any 'complicity' between the use of the
fetal tissue and the carrying out of the abortion, or to ensure
that fetal tissue use does not contribute to a higher incidence
of abortions, then the arguments presented in this chapter count
against that view. At least when carried out before 18 weeks,
abortion is in itself morally neutral. Even later abortions, when
some pain may be involved, could be justified if the outcome
were to prevent much greater suffering by saving the life of a
child suffering from an immune system disorder, or to cure
Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease in an older person. If the
requirement that we separate the act of abortion from the donation of fetal tissue cannot be soundly based on the need to
protect the fetus, can it be founded instead on a need to protect
the parents, in particular the woman? Different aspects of this
separation need to be considered. If the doctor counselling the
pregnant woman about her abortion and the doctor seeking
fetal tissue for a dying patient are one and the same, the conflict
of interest is clear, and there seems a real risk that the doctor
will not be able to give disinterested advice to the pregnant
woman. So this separation is an important aspect of protecting
the position of the pregnant woman.
What, though, of the view that the pregnant woman must
166 

be separated from the recipient by a veil of anonymity? This,
of course, prevents her having an abortion in order to provide
tissue to someone she knows. Is this restriction justified by consideration of her own interests? On the one hand, without this
protection it is easy to imagine scenarios in which a pregnant
woman would find herself under great pressure to abort a pregnancy in order to save the life of a dying relative; or a woman
who is not pregnant might feel that she has to become pregnant
and then terminate the pregnancy to provide the needed fetal
tissue. Feminists may well feel that in a society in which men
are dominant, the prospects for further intensifying the oppression of women in this way is reason enough to exclude the
designation of tissue for a particular known person.
Yet the argument for the opposite conclusion is also strong.
It is neither unusual nor unreasonable for a parent to make
great sacrifices for a child. We allow both men and women to
work long hours doing meaningless factory labor in order to
save enough money to ensure that their children receive a good
education. This suggests that sacrifice for the sake of a relative
or loved one is not in itself wrong or something we need to
prohibit. In many countries, we also allow women to have
abortions for reasons that are far less important than the saving
of a life. This indicates that we do not regard an abortion as
something so bad (from the point of view of the fetus, or of the
woman) that it should be prohibited, or even restricted to situations in which it is necessary to save a life. If we accept the
assumptions that underly both these attitudes, we can scarcely
criticise a woman who decides to have an abortion in order to
provide fetal tissue that could save the life of her child. Not
every woman may want to do this, but those who do may well
be making a perfectly reasonable, autonomous decision. It is
highly paternalistic for the law to step in and say that a doctor
must not give effect to such decisions. From this perspective it
is odd that some feminists, whom one might expect to find
upholding the right of women to autonomy, should be among
167 

those who think that women need special laws to protect them
against the effects of their own freely chosen actions.
There is considerable force in both of these opposed arguments, but we should favour autonomy unless there is clear
evidence that the results of doing so are very bad indeed. I know
of no evidence to that effect. I suspect, in fact, that much (though
certainly not all) of the motivation for prohibiting designated
donations of tissue derives from a desire to avoid causing more
abortions, and in particular, to avoid women becoming pregnant in order to make fetal tissue available. But for the reasons
already given, I see nothing inherently wrong with more abortions, or with pregnancies being undertaken in order to provide
fetal tissue, as long as the women involved are freely choosing
to do this, and the additional abortions really do make some
contribution to saving the lives of others. If the chief objection
is that the women's actions might be coerced rather than freely
chosen, the solution would be not to prohibit all choices for
abortion to provide fetal tissue, but rather to set up procedures
to ensure that those who do this have chosen freely, in the light
of all the available relevant information.
At this point commerce is bound to rear its head. Someone
will ask: What if women become pregnant and terminate their
pregnancies not in order to save the lives of those they care
about, but because they will be paid for the fetal tissue? Do not
arguments from autonomy suggest that this, too, should be up
to the woman to decide? Is it really worse to become pregnant
and terminate the pregnancy in order to receive, say, $10,000
than to spend six months doing repetitious labour in a noisy,
polluted, hazardous factory for the same amount of money?
Despite my willingness to facilitate fetal tissue use, I am much
more reluctant to embrace the free market. This is not because
I think that women would be unable to protect themselves from
the exploitation of the market; it really does not seem to me a
worse form of exploitation than those that we accept in more
common forms of employment. Rather, I dislike the idea of a
168 

free market in fetal tissue because, as R.M. Titmuss argued many
years ago in the case of blood supplies for medical purposes,
when we choose between a social policy based on altruism and
one based on commerce, we are choosing between two different
types of society. It may well be better, for a variety of reasons,
that there are some things that money cannot buy; some circumstances in which we must rely on the altruism of those we
love, or even of strangers in our society. I support efforts to
resist the creeping commercialisation of every aspect of our lives,
and so I would resist the commercialisation of fetal tissue.
ABORTION AND INFANTICIDE
There remains one major objection to the argument I have
advanced in favour of abortion. We have already seen that the
strength of the conservative position lies in the difficulty liberals
have in pointing to a morally significant line of demarcation
between an embryo and a newborn baby. The standard liberal
position needs to be able to point to some such line, because
liberals usually hold that it is permissible to kill an embryo or
fetus but not a baby. I have argued that the life of a fetus (and
even more plainly, of an embryo) is of no greater value than
the life of a nonhuman animal at a similar level of rationality,
self-consciousness, awareness, capacity to feel, etc., and that
since no fetus is a person no fetus has the same claim to life as
a person. Now it must be admitted that these arguments apply
to the newborn baby as much as to the fetus. A week-old baby
is not a rational and self-conscious being, and there are many
nonhuman animals whose rationality, self-consciousness,
awareness, capacity to feel, and so on, exceed that of a human
baby a week or a month old. If the fetus does not have the same
claim to life as a person, it appears that the newborn baby does
not either, and the life of a newborn baby is of less value to it
than the life of a pig, a dog, or a chimpanzee is to the nonhuman
animal. Thus while my position on the status of fetal life may
169 

be acceptable to many, the implications of this position for the
status of newborn life are at odds with the virtually unchallenged assumption that the life of a newborn baby is as sacrosanct
as that of an adult. Indeed, some people seem to think that the
life of a baby is more precious than that of an adult. Lurid tales
of German soldiers bayoneting Belgian babies figured prominently in the wave of anti-German propaganda that accompanied Britain's entry into the First World War, and it seemed
to be tacitly assumed that this was a greater atrocity than the
murder of adults would be.
I do not regard the conflict between the position I have taken
and widely accepted views about the sanctity of infant life as a
ground for abandoning my position. These widely accepted
views need to be challenged. It is true that infants appeal to us
because they are small and helpless, and there are no doubt
very good evolutionary reasons why we should instinctively
feel protective towards them. It is also true that infants cannot
be combatants and killing infants in wartime is the clearest
possible case of killing civilians, which is prohibited by international convention. In general, since infants are harmless and
morally incapable of committing a crime, those who kill them
lack the excuses often offered for the killing of adults. None of
this shows, however, that the killing of an infant is as bad as
the killing of an (innocent) adult.
In thinking about this matter we should put aside feelings
based on the small, helpless, and - sometimes - cute appearance
of human infants. To think that the lives of infants are of special
value because infants are small and cute is on a par with thinking
that a baby seal, with its soft white fur coat and large round
eyes deserves greater protection than a gorilla, who lacks these
attributes. Nor can the helplessness or the innocence of the
infant Homo sapiens be a ground for preferring it to the equally
helpless and innocent fetal Homo sapiens, or, for that matter,
to laboratory rats who are 'innocent' in exactly the same sense
170 

as the human infant, and, in view of the experimenters' power
over them, almost as helpless.
If we can put aside these emotionally moving but strictly
irrelevant aspects of the killing of a baby we can see that the
grounds for not killing persons do not apply to newborn infants.
The indirect, classical utilitarian reason does not apply, because
no one capable of understanding what is happening when a
newborn baby is killed could feel threatened by a policy that
gave less protection to the newborn than to adults. In this respect
Bentham was right to describe infanticide as 'of a nature not to
give the slightest inquietude to the most timid imagination'.
Once we are old enough to comprehend the policy, we are too
old to be threatened by it.
Similarly, the preference utilitarian reason for respecting the
life of a person cannot apply to a newborn baby. Newborn babies
cannot see themselves as beings who might or might not have
a future, and so cannot have a desire to continue living. For the
same reason, if a right to life must be based on the capacity to
want to go on living, or on the ability to see oneself as a continuing mental subject, a newborn baby cannot have a right to
life. Finally, a newborn baby is not an autonomous being, capable of making choices, and so to kill a newborn baby cannot
violate the principle of respect for autonomy. In all this the
newborn baby is on the same footing as the fetus, and hence
fewer reasons exist against killing both babies and fetuses than
exist against killing those who are capable of seeing themselves
as distinct entities, existing over time.
It would, of course, be difficult to say at what age children
begin to see themselves as distinct entities existing over time.
Even when we talk with two and three year old children it
is usually very difficult to elicit any coherent conception of
death, or of the possibility that someone - let alone the child
herself - might cease to exist. No doubt children vary greatly
in the age at which they begin to understand these matters,
171 

as they do in most things. But a difficulty in drawing the line
is not a reason for drawing it in a place that is obviously
wrong, any more than the notorious difficulty in saying how
much hair a man has to have lost before we can call him
'bald' is a reason for saying that someone whose pate is as
smooth as a billiard ball is not bald. Of course, where rights
are at risk, we should err on the side of safety. There is some
plausibility in the view that, for legal purposes, since birth
provides the only sharp, clear and easily understood line, the
law of homicide should continue to apply immediately after
birth. Since this is an argument at the level of public policy
and the law, it is quite compatible with the view that, on
purely ethical grounds, the killing of a newborn infant is not
comparable with the killing of an older child or adult. Alternatively, recalling Hare's distinction between the critical and
intuitive levels of moral reasoning, one could hold that the
ethical judgment we have reached applies only at the level of
critical morality; for everyday decision-making, we should act
as if an infant has a right to life from the moment of birth.
In the next chapter, however, we shall consider another possibility: that there should be at least some circumstances in
which a full legal right to life comes into force not at birth,
but only a short time after birth - perhaps a month. This
would provide the ample safety margin mentioned above.
If these conclusions seem too shocking to take seriously, it
may be worth remembering that our present absolute protection of the lives of infants is a distinctively Christian attitude
rather than a universal ethical value. Infanticide has been
practised in societies ranging geographically from Tahiti to
Greenland and varying in culture from the nomadic Australian
aborigines to the sophisticated urban communities of ancient
Greece or mandarin China. In some of these societies infanticide was not merely permitted but, in certain circumstances,
deemed morally obligatory. Not to kill a deformed or sickly
infant was often regarded as wrong, and infanticide was prob172 

ably the first, and in several societies the only, form of population control.
We might think that we are just more 'civilised' than these
'primitive' peoples. But it is not easy to feel confident that we
are more civilised than the best Greek and Roman moralists. It
was not just the Spartans who exposed their infants on hillsides:
both Plato and Aristotle recommended the killing of deformed
infants. Romans like Seneca, whose compassionate moral sense
strikes the modern reader (or me, anyway) as superior to that
of the early and mediaeval Christian writers, also thought infanticide the natural and humane solution to the problem posed
by sick and deformed babies. The change in Western attitudes
to infanticide since Roman times is, like the doctrine of the
sanctity of human life of which it is a part, a product of Christianity. Perhaps it is now possible to think about these issues
without assuming the Christian moral framework that has, for
so long, prevented any fundamental reassessment.
None of this is meant to suggest that someone who goes
around randomly killing babies is morally on a par with a
woman who has an abortion. We should certainly put very
strict conditions on permissible infanticide; but these restrictions
might owe more to the effects of infanticide on others than to
the intrinsic wrongness of killing an infant. Obviously, in most
cases, to kill an infant is to inflict a terrible loss on those who
love and cherish the child. My comparison of abortion and
infanticide was prompted by the objection that the position I
have taken on abortion also justifies infanticide. I have admitted
this charge - without regarding the admission as fatal to my
position - to the extent that the intrinsic wrongness of killing
the late fetus and the intrinsic wrongness of killing the newborn
infant are not markedly different. In cases of abortion, however,
we assume that the people most affected - the parents-to-be,
or at least the mother-to-be - want to have the abortion. Thus
infanticide can only be equated with abortion when those closest to the child do not want it to live. As an infant can be adopted
173 

by others in a way that a pre-viable fetus cannot be, such cases
will be rare. (Some of them are discussed in the following chapter.) Killing an infant whose parents do not want it dead is, of
course, an utterly different matter.

TAKING LIFE: HUMANS
I
N dealing with an objection to the view of abortion presented
in Chapter 6, we have already looked beyond abortion to
infanticide. In so doing we will have confirmed the suspicion
of supporters of the sanctity of human life that once abortion
is accepted, euthanasia lurks around the next corner - and for
them, euthanasia is an unequivocal evil. It has, they point out,
been rejected by doctors since the fifth century B.C., when physicians first took the Oath of Hippocrates and swore 'to give no
deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel'. Moreover, they argue, the Nazi extermination programme
is a recent and terrible example of what can happen once we
give the state the power to kill innocent human beings.
I do not deny that if one accepts abortion on the grounds
provided in Chapter 6, the case for killing other human beings,
in certain circumstances, is strong. As I shall try to show in this
chapter, however, this is not something to be regarded with
horror, and the use of the Nazi analogy is utterly misleading.
On the contrary, once we abandon those doctrines about the
sanctity of human life that - as we saw in Chapter 4 - collapse
as soon as they are questioned, it is the refusal to accept killing
that, in some cases, is horrific.
'Euthanasia' means, according to the dictionary, 'a gentle and
easy death', but it is now used to refer to the killing of those
who are incurably ill and in great pain or distress, for the sake
of those killed, and in order to spare them further suffering or
distress. This is the main topic of this chapter. I shall also consider, however, some cases in which, though killing is not con175 

trary to the wishes of the human who is killed, it is also not
carried out specifically for the sake of that being. As we shall
see, some cases involving newborn infants fall into this category.
Such cases may not be 'euthanasia' within the strict meaning
of the term, but they can usefully be included within the same
general discussion, as long as we are clear about the relevant
differences.
Within the usual definition of euthanasia there are three different types, each of which raises distinctive ethical issues. It
will help our discussion if we begin by setting out this threefold
distinction and then assess the justifiability of each type.
TYPES OF EUTHANASIA
Voluntary Euthanasia
Most of the groups currently campaigning for changes in the
law to allow euthanasia are campaigning for voluntary euthanasia — that is, euthanasia carried out at the request of the person
killed.
Sometimes voluntary euthanasia is scarcely distinguishable
from assisted suicide. In Jean's Way, Derek Humphry has told
how his wife Jean, when dying of cancer, asked him to provide
her with the means to end her life swiftly and without pain.
They had seen the situation coming and discussed it beforehand.
Derek obtained some tablets and gave them to Jean, who took
them and died soon afterwards.
Dr Jack Kevorkian, a Michigan pathologist, went one step
further when he built a 'suicide machine' to help terminally ill
people commit suicide. His machine consisted of a metal pole
with three different bottles attached to a tube of the kind used
to provide an intravenous drip. The doctor inserts the tube in
the patient's vein, but at this stage only a harmless saline solution can pass through it. The patient may then flip a switch,
which will allow a coma-inducing drug to come through the
176 

tube; this is automatically followed by a lethal drug contained
in the third bottle. Dr Kevorkian announced that he was prepared to make the machine available to any terminally ill patient
w ho wished to use it. (Assisting suicide is not against the law
in Michigan.) In June 1990, Janet Adkins, who was suffering
from Alzheimer's disease, but still competent to make the decision to end her life, contacted Dr Kevorkian and told him of
her wish to die, rather than go through the slow and progressive
deterioration that the disease involves. Dr Kevorkian was in
attendance while she made use of his machine, and then reported Janet Adkins's death to the police. He was subsequently
charged with murder, but the judge refused to allow the charge
to proceed to trial, on the grounds that Janet Adkins had caused
her own death. The following year Dr Kevorkian made his
device available to two other people, who used it in order to
end their lives.1
In other cases, people wanting to die may be unable to kill
themselves. In 1973 George Zygmaniak was injured in a motorcycle accident near his home in New Jersey. He was taken
to hospital, where he was found to be totally paralysed from
the neck down. He was also in considerable pain. He told his
doctor and his brother, Lester, that he did not want to live in
this condition. He begged them both to kill him. Lester questioned the doctor and hospital staff about George's prospects of
recovery: he was told that they were nil. He then smuggled a
gun into the hospital, and said to his brother: 'I am here to end
your pain, George. Is it all right with you?' George, who was
now unable to speak because of an operation to assist his breathing, nodded affirmatively. Lester shot him through the temple.
The Zygmaniak case appears to be a clear instance of voluntary euthanasia, although without some of the procedural
1 Dr Kevorkian was again charged with murder, and with providing a prohibited substance, in connection with the latter two cases, but was once more
discharged.
177 

safeguards that advocates of the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia propose. For instance, medical opinions about the patient's prospects of recovery were obtained only in an informal
manner. Nor was there a careful attempt to establish, before
independent witnesses, that George's desire for death was of a
fixed and rational kind, based on the best available information
about his situation. The killing was not carried out by a doctor.
An injection would have been less distressing to others than
shooting. But these choices were not open to Lester Zygmaniak,
for the law in New Jersey, as in most other places, regards mercy
killing as murder, and if he had made his plans known, he
would not have been able to carry them out.
Euthanasia can be voluntary even if a person is not able, as
Jean Humphry, Janet Adkins, and George Zygmaniak were able,
to indicate the wish to die right up to the moment the tablets
are swallowed, the switch thrown, or the trigger pulled. A person may, while in good health, make a written request for
euthanasia if, through accident or illness, she should come to
be incapable of making or expressing a decision to die, in pain,
or without the use of her mental faculties, and there is no
reasonable hope of recovery. In killing a person who has made
such a request, who has re-affirmed it from time to time, and
who is now in one of the states described, one could truly claim
to be acting with her consent.
There is now one country in which doctors can openly help
their patients to die in a peaceful and dignified way. In the
Netherlands, a series of court cases during the 1980s upheld a
doctor's right to assist a patient to die, even if that assistance
amounted to giving the patient a lethal injection. Doctors in the
Netherlands who comply with certain guidelines (which will
be described later in this chapter) can now quite openly carry
out euthanasia and can report this on the death certificate without fear of prosecution. It has been estimated that about 2,300
deaths each year result from euthanasia carried out in this way.
178 

Involuntary Euthanasia
I shall regard euthanasia as involuntary when the person killed
is capable of consenting to her own death, but does not do so,
either because she is not asked, or because she is asked and
chooses to go on living. Admittedly this definition lumps two
different cases under one heading. There is a significant difference between killing someone who chooses to go on living and
killing someone who has not consented to being killed, but if
asked, would have consented. In practice, though, it is hard to
imagine cases in which a person is capable of consenting and
would have consented if asked, but was not asked. For why
not ask? Only in the most bizarre situations could one conceive
of a reason for not obtaining the consent of a person both able
and willing to consent.
Killing someone who has not consented to being killed can
properly be regarded as euthanasia only when the motive for
killing is the desire to prevent unbearable suffering on the part
of the person killed. It is, of course, odd that anyone acting from
this motive should disregard the wishes of the person for whose
sake the action is done. Genuine cases of involuntary euthanasia
appear to be very rare.
Non-voluntary Euthanasia
These two definitions leave room for a third kind of euthanasia.
If a human being is not capable of understanding the choice
between life and death, euthanasia would be neither voluntary
nor involuntary, but non-voluntary. Those unable to give consent would include incurably ill or severely disabled infants, and
people who through accident, illness, or old age have permanently lost the capacity to understand the issue involved, without having previously requested or rejected euthanasia in these
circumstances.
179 

Several cases of non-voluntary euthanasia have reached the
courts and the popular press. Here is one example. Louis Repouille had a son who was described as 'incurably imbecile',
had been bed-ridden since infancy and blind for five years.
According to Repouille: 'He was just like dead all the time He
couldn't walk, he couldn't talk, he couldn't do anything.' In
the end Repouille killed his son with chloroform.
In 1988 a case arose that well illustrates the way in which
modem medical technology forces us to make life and death
decisions. Samuel Linares, an infant, swallowed a small object
that stuck in his windpipe, causing a loss of oxygen to the brain.
He was admitted to a Chicago hospital in a coma and placed
on a respirator. Eight months later he was still comatose, still
on the respirator, and the hospital was planning to move Samuel
to a long-term care unit. Shortly before the move, Samuel's
parents visited him in the hospital. His mother left the room,
while his father produced a pistol and told the nurse to keep
away. He then disconnected Samuel from the respirator, and
cradled the baby in his arms until he died. When he was sure
Samuel was dead, he gave up his pistol and surrendered to
police. He was charged with murder, but the grand jury refused
to issue a homicide indictment, and he subsequently received
a suspended sentence on a minor charge arising from the use
of the pistol.
Obviously, such cases raise different issues from those raised
by voluntary euthanasia. There is no desire to die on the part
of the infant. It may also be questioned whether, in such cases,
the death is carried out for the sake of the infant, or for the sake
of the family as a whole. If Louis Repouille's son was 'just like
dead all the time', then he may have been so profoundly braindamaged that he was not capable of suffering at all. That is also
likely to have been true of the comatose Samuel Linares. In that
case, while caring for him would have been a great and no
doubt futile burden for the family, and in the Linares case, a
drain on the state's limited medical resources as well, the infants
180 

were not suffering, and death could not be said to be in, or
contrary to, their interests. It is therefore not euthanasia, strictly
speaking, as I have defined the term. It might nevertheless be
a justifiable ending of a human life.
Since cases of infanticide and non-voluntary euthanasia are
the kind of case most nearly akin to our previous discussions
of the status of animals and the human fetus, we shall consider
them first.
JUSTIFYING INFANTICIDE AND
NON-VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA
As we have seen, euthanasia is non-voluntary when the subject has never had the capacity to choose to live or die. This is
the situation of the severely disabled infant or the older human being who has been profoundly intellectually disabled
since birth. Euthanasia or other forms of killing are also nonvoluntary when the subject is not now but once was capable
of making the crucial choice, and did not then express any
preference relevant to her present condition.
The case of someone who has never been capable of choosing
to live or die is a little more straightforward than that of a person
who had, but has now lost, the capacity to make such a decision.
We shall, once again, separate the two cases and take the more
straightforward one first. For simplicity, I shall concentrate on
infants, although everything I say about them would apply to
older children or adults whose mental age is and has always
been that of an infant.
Life and Death Decisions for Disabled Infants
If we were to approach the issue of life or death for a seriously
disabled human infant without any prior discussion of the ethics
181 

of killing in general, we might be unable to resolve the conflict
between the widely accepted obligation to protect the sanctity
of human life, and the goal of reducing suffering. Some say that
such decisions are 'subjective', or that life and death questions
must be left to God and Nature. Our previous discussions have,
however, prepared the ground, and the principles established
and applied in the preceding three chapters make the issue much
less baffling than most take it to be.
In Chapter 4 we saw that the fact that a being is a human
being, in the sense of a member of the species Homo sapiens,
is not relevant to the wrongness of killing it; it is, rather, characteristics like rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness
that make a difference. Infants lack these characteristics. Killing
them, therefore, cannot be equated with killing normal human
beings, or any other self-conscious beings. This conclusion is
not limited to infants who, because of irreversible intellectual
disabilities, will never be rational, self-conscious beings. We saw
in our discussion of abortion that the potential of a fetus to
become a rational, self-conscious being cannot count against
killing it at a stage when it lacks these characteristics - not, that
is, unless we are also prepared to count the value of rational
self-conscious life as a reason against contraception and celibacy. No infant - disabled or not - has as strong a claim to life
as beings capable of seeing themselves as distinct entities, existing over time.
The difference between killing disabled and normal infants
lies not in any supposed right to life that the latter has and the
former lacks, but in other considerations about killing. Most
obviously there is the difference that often exists in the attitudes
of the parents. The birth of a child is usually a happy event for
the parents. They have, nowadays, often planned for the child.
The mother has carried it for nine months. From birth, a natural
affection begins to bind the parents to it. So one important
reason why it is normally a terrible thing to kill an infant is the
effect the killing will have on its parents.
182 

It is different when the infant is born with a serious disability.
Birth abnormalities vary, of course. Some are trivial and have
little effect on the child or its parents; but others turn the normally joyful event of birth into a threat to the happiness of the
parents, and any other children they may have.
Parents may, with good reason, regret that a disabled child
was ever born. In that event the effect that the death of the
child will have on its parents can be a reason for, rather than
against killing it. Some parents want even the most gravely
disabled infant to live as long as possible, and this desire would
then be a reason against killing the infant. But what if this is
not the case? In the discussion that follows I shall assume that
the parents do not want the disabled child to live. I shall also
assume that the disability is so serious that - again in contrast
to the situation of an unwanted but normal child today - there
are no other couples keen to adopt the infant. This is a realistic
assumption even in a society in which there is a long waitinglist of couples wishing to adopt normal babies. It is true that
from time to time cases of infants who are severely disabled and
are being allowed to die have reached the courts in a glare of
publicity, and this has led to couples offering to adopt the child.
Unfortunately such offers are the product of the highly publicised dramatic life-and-death situation, and do not extend to
the less publicised but far more common situations in which
parents feel themselves unable to look after a severely disabled
child, and the child then languishes in an institution.
Infants are sentient beings who are neither rational nor selfconscious. So if we turn to consider the infants in themselves,
independently of the attitudes of their parents, since their species
is not relevant to their moral status, the principles that govern
the wrongness of killing non-human animals who are sentient
but not rational or self-conscious must apply here too. As we
saw, the most plausible arguments for attributing a right to life
to a being apply only if there is some awareness of oneself as
a being existing over time, or as a continuing mental self. Nor
183 

can respect for autonomy apply where there is no capacity for
autonomy. The remaining principles identified in Chapter 4 are
utilitarian. Hence the quality of life that the infant can be expected to have is important.
One relatively common birth disability is a faulty development
of the spine known as spina bifida. Its prevalence varies in
different countries, but it can affect as many as one in five
hundred live births. In the more severe cases, the child will be
permanently paralysed from the waist down and lack control
of bowels or bladder. Often excess fluid accumulates in the
brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus, which can result
in intellectual disabilities. Though some forms of treatment exist,
if the child is badly affected at birth, the paralysis, incontinence,
and intellectual disability cannot be overcome.
Some doctors closely connected with children suffering from
severe spina bifida believe that the lives of the worst affected
children are so miserable that it is wrong to resort to surgery
to keep them alive. Published descriptions of the lives of these
children support the judgment that these worst affected children
will have lives filled with pain and discomfort. They need repeated major surgery to prevent curvature of the spine, due to
the paralysis, and to correct other abnormalities. Some children
with spina bifida have had forty major operations before they
reach their teenage years.
When the life of an infant will be so miserable as not to be
worth living, from the internal perspective of the being who
will lead that life, both the 'prior existence' and the 'total' version of utilitarianism entail that, if there are no 'extrinsic' reasons for keeping the infant alive - like the feelings 6f the parents
- it is better that the child should be helped to die without
further suffering. A more difficult problem arises - and the convergence between the two views ends - when we consider
disabilities that make the child's life prospects significantly less
promising than those of a normal child, but not so bleak as to
make the child's life not worth living. Haemophilia is probably
184 

in this category. The haemophiliac lacks the element in normal
blood that makes it clot and thus risks prolonged bleeding,
especially internal bleeding, from the slightest injury. If allowed
to continue, this bleeding leads to permanent crippling and
eventually death. The bleeding is very painful and although
improved treatments have eliminated the need for constant
blood transfusions, haemophiliacs still have to spend a lot of
time in hospital. They are unable to play most sports and live
constantly on the edge of crisis. Nevertheless, haemophiliacs do
not appear to spend their time wondering whether to end it
all; most find life definitely worth living, despite the difficulties
they face.
Given these facts, suppose that a newborn baby is diagnosed
as a haemophiliac. The parents, daunted by the prospect of
bringing up a child with this condition, are not anxious for him
to live. Could euthanasia be defended here? Our first reaction
may well be a firm 'no', for the infant can be expected to have
a life that is worth living, even if not quite as good as that of a
normal baby. The 'prior existence' version of utilitarianism supports this judgment. The infant exists. His life can be expected
to contain a positive balance of happiness over misery. To kill
him would deprive him of this positive balance of happiness.
Therefore it would be wrong.
On the 'total' version of utilitarianism, however, we cannot
reach a decision on the basis of this information alone. The total
view makes it necessary to ask whether the death of the haemophiliac infant would lead to the creation of another being
who would not otherwise have existed. In other words, if the
haemophiliac child is killed, will his parents have another child
whom they would not have if the haemophiliac child lives? If
they would, is the second child likely to have a better life than
the one killed?
Often it will be possible to answer both these questions affirmatively. A woman may plan to have two children. If one
dies while she is of child-bearing age, she may conceive another
185 

in its place. Suppose a woman planning to have two children
has one normal child, and then gives birth to a haemophiliac
child. The burden of caring for that child may make it impossible
for her to cope with a third child; but if the disabled child were
to die, she would have another. It is also plausible to suppose
that the prospects of a happy life are better for a normal child
than for a haemophiliac.
When the death of a disabled infant will lead to the birth of
another infant with better prospects of a happy life, the total
amount of happiness will be greater if the disabled infant is
killed. The loss of happy life for the first infant is outweighed
by the gain of a happier life for the second. Therefore, if killing
the haemophiliac infant has no adverse effect on others, it
would, according to the total view, be right to kill him.
The total view treats infants as replaceable, in much the same
way as it treats non-self-conscious animals (as we saw in Chapter 5). Many will think that the replaceability argument cannot
be applied to human infants. The direct killing of even the most
hopelessly disabled infant is still officially regarded as murder;
how then could the killing of infants with far less serious problems, like haemophilia, be accepted? Yet on further reflection,
the implications of the replaceability argument do not seem
quite so bizarre. For there are disabled members of our species
whom we now deal with exactly as the argument suggests we
should. These cases closely resemble the ones we have been
discussing. There is only one difference, and that is a difference
of timing - the timing of the discovery of the problem, and the
consequent killing of the disabled being.
Prenatal diagnosis is now a routine procedure for pregnant
women. There are various medical techniques for obtaining
information about the fetus during the early months of pregnancy. At one stage in the development of these procedures, it
was possible to discover the sex of the fetus, but not whether
the fetus would suffer from haemophilia. Haemophilia is a sexlinked genetic defect, from which only males suffer; females can
186 

carry the gene and pass it on to their male offspring without
themselves being affected. So a woman who knew that she
carried the gene for haemophilia could, at that stage, avoid
giving birth to a haemophiliac child only by finding out the sex
of the fetus, and aborting all males fetuses. Statistically, only
half of these male children of women who carried the defective
gene would have suffered from haemophilia, but there was then
no way to find out to which half a particular fetus belonged.
Therefore twice as many fetuses were being killed as necessary,
in order to avoid the birth of children with haemophilia. This
practice was widespread in many countries, and yet did not
cause any great outcry. Now that we have techniques for
identifying haemophilia before birth, we can be more selective,
but the principle is the same: women are offered, and usually
accept, abortions in order to avoid giving birth to children with
haemophilia.
The same can be said about some other conditions that can
be detected before birth. Down's syndrome, formerly known as
mongolism, is one of these. Children with this condition have
intellectual disabilities and most will never be able to live independently, but their lives, like those of small children, can be
joyful. The risk of having a Down's syndrome child increases
sharply with the age of the mother, and for this reason prenatal
diagnosis is routinely offered to pregnant women over 35.
Again, undergoing the procedure implies that if the test for
Down's syndrome is positive, the woman will consider aborting
the fetus and, if she still wishes to have another child, will start
another pregnancy, which has a good chance of being normal.
Prenatal diagnosis, followed by abortion in selected cases, is
common practice in countries with liberal abortion laws and
advanced medical techniques. I think this is as it should be. As
the arguments of Chapter 6 indicate, I believe that abortion can
be justified. Note, however, that neither haemophilia nor
Down's syndrome is so crippling as to make life not worth living,
from the inner perspective of the person with the condition. To
187 

abort a fetus with one of these disabilities, intending to have
another child who will not be disabled, is to treat fetuses as
interchangeable or replaceable. If the mother has previously
decided to have a certain number of children, say two, then
what she is doing, in effect, is rejecting one potential child in
favour of another. She could, in defence of her actions, say: the
loss of life of the aborted fetus is outweighed by the gain of a
better life for the normal child who will be conceived only if
the disabled one dies.
When death occurs before birth, replaceability does not conflict with generally accepted moral convictions. That a fetus is
known to be disabled is widely accepted as a ground for abortion. Yet in discussing abortion, we saw that birth does not
mark a morally significant dividing line. I cannot see how one
could defend the view that fetuses may be 'replaced' before
birth, but newborn infants may not be. Nor is there any other
point, such as viability, that does a better job of dividing the
fetus from the infant. Self-consciousness, which could provide
a basis for holding that it is wrong to kill one being and replace
it with another, is not to be found in either the fetus or the
newborn infant. Neither the fetus nor the newborn infant is an
individual capable of regarding itself as a distinct entity with a
life of its own to lead, and it is only for newborn infants, or for
still earlier stages of human life, that replaceability should be
considered to be an ethically acceptable option.
It may still be objected that to replace either a fetus or a
newborn infant is wrong because it suggests to disabled people
living today that their lives are less worth living than the lives
of people who are not disabled. Yet it is surely flying in the face
of reality to deny that, on average, this is so. That is the only
way to make sense of actions that we all take for granted. Recall
thalidomide: this drug, when taken by pregnant women, caused
many children to be born without arms or legs. Once the cause
of the abnormal births was discovered, the drug was taken off
the market, and the company responsible had to pay compen188 

sation. If we really believed that there is no reason to think of
the life of a disabled person as likely to be any worse than that
of a normal person, we would not have regarded this as a
tragedy. No compensation would have been sought, or awarded
by the courts. The children would merely have been 'different'.
We could even have left the drug on the market, so that women
who found it a useful sleeping pill during pregnancy could continue to take it. If this sounds grotesque, that is only because
we are all in no doubt at all that it is better to be born with
limbs than without them. To believe this involves no disrespect
at all for those who are lacking limbs; it simply recognises the
reality of the difficulties they face.
In any case, the position taken here does not imply that it
would be better that no people born with severe disabilities
should survive; it implies only that the parents of such infants
should be able to make this decision. Nor does this imply lack
of respect or equal consideration for people with disabilities who
are now living their own lives in accordance with their own
wishes. As we saw at the end of Chapter 2, the principle of
equal consideration of interests rejects any discounting of the
interests of people on grounds of disability.
Even those who reject abortion and the idea that the fetus is
replaceable are likely to regard possible people as replaceable.
Recall the second woman in Parfit's case of the two women,
described in Chapter 5. She was told by her doctor that if she
went ahead with her plan to become pregnant immediately,
her child would have a disability (it could have been haemophilia); but if she waited three months her child would not have
the disability. If we think she would do wrong not to wait, it
can only be because we are comparing the two possible lives
and judging one to have better prospects than the other. Of
course, at this stage no life has begun; but the question is, when
does a life, in the morally significant sense, really begin? In
Chapters 4 and 5 we saw several reasons for saying that life
only begins in the morally significant sense when there is aware189 

ness of one's existence over time. The metaphor of life as a
journey also provides a reason for holding that in infancy, life's
voyage has scarcely begun.
Regarding newborn infants as replaceable, as we now regard
fetuses, would have considerable advantages over prenatal diagnosis followed by abortion. Prenatal diagnosis still cannot
detect all major disabilities. Some disabilities, in fact, are not
present before birth; they may be the result of extremely premature birth, or of something going wrong in the birth process
itself. At present parents can choose to keep or destroy their
disabled offspring only if the disability happens to be detected
during pregnancy. There is no logical basis for restricting parents' choice to these particular disabilities. If disabled newborn
infants were not regarded as having a right to life until, say, a
week or a month after birth it would allow parents, in consultation with their doctors, to choose on the basis of far greater
knowledge of the infant's condition than is possible before birth.
All these remarks have been concerned with the wrongness
of ending the life of the infant, considered in itself rather than
for its effects on others. When we take effects on others into
account, the picture may alter. Obviously, to go through the
whole of pregnancy and labour, only to give birth to a child
who one decides should not live, would be a difficult, perhaps
heartbreaking, experience. For this reason many women would
prefer prenatal diagnosis and abortion rather than live birth with
the possibility of infanticide; but if the latter is not morally worse
than the former, this would seem to be a choice that the woman
herself should be allowed to make.
Another factor to take into account is the possibility of adoption. When there are more couples wishing to adopt than normal children available for adoption, a childless couple may be
prepared to adopt a haemophiliac. This would relieve the
mother of the burden of bringing up a haemophiliac child, and
enable her to have another child, if she wished. Then the replaceability argument could not justify infanticide, for bringing
190 

the other child into existence would not be dependent on the
death of the haemophiliac. The death of the haemophiliac would
then be a straightforward loss of a life of positive quality, not
outweighed by the creation of another being with a better life.
So the issue of ending life for disabled newborn infants is not
without complications, which we do not have the space to
discuss adequately. Nevertheless the main point is clear: killing
a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person.
Very often it is not wrong at all.
Other Non-voluntary Life and Death Decisions
In the preceding section we discussed justifiable killing for
beings who have never been capable of choosing to live or die.
Ending a life without consent may also be considered in the
case of those who were once persons capable of choosing to
live or die, but now, through accident or old age, have permanently lost this capacity, and did not, prior to losing it, express
any views about whether they wished to go on living in such
circumstances. These cases are not rare. Many hospitals care for
motor accident victims whose brains have been damaged beyond all possible recovery. They may survive, in a coma, or
perhaps barely conscious, for several years. In 1991, the Lancet
reported that Rita Greene, a nurse, had been a patient at D.C.
General Hospital in Washington for thirty-nine years without
knowing it. Now aged sixty-three, she had been in a vegetative
state since undergoing open heart surgery in 1952. The report
stated that at any given time, between 5,000 and 10,000 Americans are surviving in a vegetative state. In other developed
countries, where life-prolonging technology is not used so aggressively, there are far fewer long-term patients in this
condition.
In most respects, these human beings do not differ importantly from disabled infants. They are not self-conscious, rational, or autonomous, and so considerations of a right to life
191 

or of respecting autonomy do not apply. If they have no experiences at all, and can never have any again, their lives have
no intrinsic value. Their life's journey has come to an end. They
are biologically alive, but not biographically. (If this verdict
seems harsh, ask yourself whether there is anything to choose
between the following options: (a) instant death or (b) instant
coma, followed by death, without recovery, in ten years' time.
I can see no advantage in survival in a comatose state, if death
without recovery is certain.) The lives of those who are not in
a coma and are conscious but not self-conscious have value if
such beings experience more pleasure than pain, or have preferences that can be satisfied; but it is difficult to see the point
of keeping such human beings alive if their life is, on the whole,
miserable.
There is one important respect in which these cases differ
from disabled infants. In discussing infanticide in the final section of Chapter 6, I cited Bentham's comment that infanticide
need not 'give the slightest inquietude to the most timid imagination'. This is because those old enough to be aware of the
killing of disabled infants are necessarily outside the scope of
the policy. This cannot be said of euthanasia applied to those
who once were rational and self-conscious. So a possible objection to this form of euthanasia would be that it will lead to
insecurity and fear among those who are not now, but might
come to be, within its scope. For instance, elderly people, knowing that non-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes applied to senile
elderly patients, bedridden, suffering, and lacking the capacity
to accept or reject death, might fear that every injection or tablet
will be lethal. This fear might be quite irrational, but it would
be difficult to convince people of this, particularly if old age
really had affected their memory or powers of reasoning.
This objection might be met by a procedure allowing those
who do not wish to be subjected to non-voluntary euthanasia
under any circumstances to register their refusal. Perhaps this
192 

would suffice; but perhaps it would not provide enough reassurance. If not, non-voluntary euthanasia would be justifiable
only for those never capable of choosing to live or die.
JUSTIFYING VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA
Under existing laws in most countries, people suffering unrelievable pain or distress from an incurable illness who beg their
doctors to end their lives are asking their doctors to risk a murder
charge. Although juries are extremely reluctant to convict in
cases of this kind the law is clear that neither the request, nor
the degree of suffering, nor the incurable condition of the person
killed, is a defence to a charge of murder. Advocates of voluntary
euthanasia propose that this law be changed so that a doctor
could legally act on a patient's desire to die without further
suffering. Doctors have been able to do this quite openly in the
Netherlands, as a result of a series of court decisions during the
1980s, as long as they comply with certain conditions. In Germany, doctors may provide a patient with the means to end her
life, but they may not administer the substance to her.
The case for voluntary euthanasia has some common ground
with the case for non-voluntary euthanasia, in that death is a
benefit for the one killed. The two kinds of euthanasia differ,
however, in that voluntary euthanasia involves the killing of a
person, a rational and self-conscious being and not a merely
conscious being. (To be strictly accurate it must be said that this
is not always so, because although only rational and self-conscious beings can consent to their own deaths, they may not be
rational and self-conscious at the time euthanasia is contemplated - the doctor may, for instance, be acting on a prior written
request for euthanasia if, through accident or illness, one's rational faculties should be irretrievably lost. For simplicity we
shall, henceforth, disregard this complication.)
We have seen that it is possible to justify ending the life of a
193 

human being who lacks the capacity to consent. We must now
ask in what way the ethical issues are different when the being
is capable of consenting, and does in fact consent.
Let us return to the general principles about killing proposed
in Chapter 4. I argued there that killing a self-conscious being
is a more serious matter than killing a merely conscious being.
I gave four distinct grounds on which this could be argued:
1 The classical utilitarian claim that since self-conscious beings
are capable of fearing their own death, killing them has worse
effects on others.
2 The preference utilitarian calculation that counts the thwarting
of the victim's desire to go on living as an important reason
against killing.
3 A theory of rights according to which to have a right one must
have the ability to desire that to which one has a right, so that
to have a right to life one must be able to desire one's own
continued existence.
4 Respect for the autonomous decisions of rational agents.
Now suppose we have a situation in which a person suffering
from a painful and incurable disease wishes to die. If the individual were not a person - not rational or self-conscious -
euthanasia would, as I have said, be justifiable. Do any of the
four grounds for holding that it is normally worse to kill a person
provide reasons against killing when the individual is a person
who wants to die?
The classical utilitarian objection does not apply to killing that
takes place only with the genuine consent of the person killed.
That people are killed under these conditions would have no
tendency to spread fear or insecurity, since we have no cause
to be fearful of being killed with our own genuine consent. If
we do not wish to be killed, we simply do not consent. In fact,
the argument from fear points in favour of voluntary euthanasia,
for if voluntary euthanasia is not permitted we may, with good
cause, be fearful that our deaths will be unnecessarily drawn
out and distressing. In the Netherlands, a nationwide study
commissioned by the government found that 'Many patients
194 

want an assurance that their doctor will assist them to die should
suffering become unbearable.' Often, having received this assurance, no persistent request for euthanasia eventuated. The
availability of euthanasia brought comfort without euthanasia
having to be provided.
Preference utilitarianism also points in favour of, not against,
voluntary euthanasia. Just as preference utilitarianism must
count a desire to go on living as a reason against killing, so it
must count a desire to die as a reason for killing.
Next, according to the theory of rights we have considered,
it is an essential feature of a right that one can waive one's
rights if one so chooses. I may have a right to privacy; but I
can, if I wish, film every detail of my daily life and invite the
neighbours to my home movies. Neighbours sufficiently intrigued to accept my invitation could do so without violating
my right to privacy, since the right has on this occasion been
waived. Similarly, to say that I have a right to life is not to say
that it would be wrong for my doctor to end my life, if she does
so at my request. In making this request I waive my right to
life.
Lastly, the principle of respect for autonomy tells us to allow
rational agents to live their own lives according to their own
autonomous decisions, free from coercion or interference; but
if rational agents should autonomously choose to die, then respect for autonomy will lead us to assist them to do as they
choose.
So, although there are reasons for thinking that killing a selfconscious being is normally worse than killing any other kind
of being, in the special case of voluntary euthanasia most of
these reasons count for euthanasia rather than against. Surprising as this result might at first seem, it really does no more
than reflect the fact that what is special about self-conscious
beings is that they can know that they exist over time and will,
unless they die, continue to exist. Normally this continued existence is fervently desired; when the foreseeable continued ex195 

istence is dreaded rather than desired however, the desire to die
may take the place of the normal desire to live, reversing the
reasons against killing based on the desire to live. Thus the case
for voluntary euthanasia is arguably much stronger than the
case for non-voluntary euthanasia.
Some opponents of the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia
might concede that all this follows, if we have a genuinely free
and rational decision to die: but, they add, we can never be
sure that a request to be killed is the result of a free and rational
decision. Will not the sick and elderly be pressured by their
relatives to end their lives quickly? Will it not be possible to
commit outright murder by pretending that a person has requested euthanasia? And even if there is no pressure of falsification, can anyone who is ill, suffering pain, and very probably
in a drugged and confused state of mind, make a rational decision about whether to live or die?
These questions raise technical difficulties for the legalisation
of voluntary euthanasia, rather than objections to the underlying ethical principles; but they are serious difficulties nonetheless. The guidelines developed by the courts in the Netherlands have sought to meet them by proposing that euthanasia is acceptable only if
• It is carried out by a physician.
• The patient has explicitly requested euthanasia in a manner
that leaves no doubt of the patient's desire to die.
• The patient's decision is well-informed, free, and durable.
• The patient has an irreversible condition causing protracted
physical or mental suffering that the patients finds unbearable.
• There is no reasonable alternative (reasonable from the patient's point of view) to alleviate the patient's suffering.
• The doctor has consulted another independent professional
who agrees with his or her judgment.
Euthanasia in these circumstances is strongly supported by the
Royal Dutch Medical Association, and by the general public in
the Netherlands. The guidelines make murder in the guise of
196 

euthanasia rather far-fetched, and there is no evidence of an
increase in the murder rate in the Netherlands.
It is often said, in debates about euthanasia, that doctors can
be mistaken. In rare instances patients diagnosed by two competent doctors as suffering from an incurable condition have
survived and enjoyed years of good health. Possibly the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia would, over the years, mean
the deaths of a few people who would otherwise have recovered
from their immediate illness and lived for some extra years. This
is not, however, the knockdown argument against euthanasia
that some imagine it to be. Against a very small number of
unnecessary deaths that might occur if euthanasia is legalised
we must place the very large amount of pain and distress that
will be suffered if euthanasia is not legalised, by patients who
really are terminally ill. Longer life is not such a supreme good
that it outweighs all other considerations. (If it were, there
would be many more effective ways of saving life - such as a
ban on smoking, or a reduction of speed limits to 40 kilometres
per hour - than prohibiting voluntary euthanasia.) The possibility that two doctors may make a mistake means that the
person who opts for euthanasia is deciding on the balance of
probabilities and giving up a very slight chance of survival in
order to avoid suffering that will almost certainly end in death.
This may be a perfectly rational choice. Probability is the guide
of life, and of death, too. Against this, some will reply that
improved care for the terminally ill has eliminated pain and
made voluntary euthanasia unnecessary. Elisabeth Kiibler-Ross,
whose On Death and Dying is perhaps the best-known book on
care for the dying, has claimed that none of her patients request
euthanasia. Given personal attention and the right medication,
she says, people come to accept their deaths and die peacefully
without pain.
Kiibler-Ross may be right. It may be possible, now, to eliminate pain. In almost all cases, it may even be possible to do it
in a way that leaves patients in possession of their rational
197 

faculties and free from vomiting, nausea, or other distressing
side-effects. Unfortunately only a minority of dying patients now
receive this kind of care. Nor is physical pain the only problem.
There can also be other distressing conditions, like bones so
fragile they fracture at sudden movements, uncontrollable nausea and vomiting, slow starvation due to a cancerous growth,
inability to control one's bowels or bladder, difficulty in breathing, and so on.
Dr Timothy Quill, a doctor from Rochester, New York, has
described how he prescribed barbiturate sleeping pills for 'Diane', a patient with a severe form of leukaemia, knowing that
she wanted the tablets in order to be able to end her life. Dr
Quill had known Diane for many years, and admired her courage in dealing with previous serious illnesses. In an article in
the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr Quill wrote:
It was extraordinarily important to Diane to maintain control of
herself and her own dignity during the time remaining to her.
When this was no longer possible, she clearly wanted to die. As
a former director of a hospice program, I know how to use pain
medicines to keep patients comfortable and lessen suffering. I
explained the philosophy of comfort care, which I strongly believe in. Although Diane understood and appreciated this, she
had known of people lingering in what was called relative comfort, and she wanted no part of it. When the time came, she
wanted to take her life in the least painful way possible. Knowing
of her desire for independence and her decision to stay in control,
I thought this request made perfect sense. .. . In our discussion
it became clear that preoccupation with her fear of a lingering
death would interfere with Diane's getting the most out of the
time she had left until she found a safe way to ensure her death.
Not all dying patients who wish to die are fortunate enough
to have a doctor like Timothy Quill. Betty Rollin has described,
in her moving book Last Wish, how her mother developed ovarian cancer that spread to other parts of her body. One morning
her mother said to her:
198 

I've had a wonderful life, but now it's over, or it should be. I'm
not afraid to die, but I am afraid of this illness, what it's doing
to me. . . . There's never any relief from it now. Nothing but
nausea and this pain. . . . There won't be any more chemotherapy. There's no treatment anymore. So what happens to me
now? I know what happens. I'll die slowly I don't want
that Who does it benefit if I die slowly? If it benefits my
children I'd be willing. But it's not going to do you any
good There's no point in a slow death, none. I've never liked
doing things with no point. I've got to end this.
Betty Rollin found it very difficult to help her mother to carry
out her desire: 'Physician after physician turned down our pleas
for help (How many pills? What kind?).' After her book about
her mother's death was published, she received hundreds of
letters, many from people, or close relatives of people, who had
tried to die, failed, and suffered even more. Many of these people
were denied help from doctors, because although suicide is legal
in most jurisdictions, assisted suicide is not.
Perhaps one day it will be possible to treat all terminally ill
and incurable patients in such a way that no one requests euthanasia and the subject becomes a non-issue; but this is now
just a Utopian ideal, and no reason at all to deny euthanasia to
those who must live and die in far less comfortable conditions.
It is, in any case, highly paternalistic to tell dying patients that
they are now so well looked after that they need not be offered
the option of euthanasia. It would be more in keeping with
respect for individual freedom and autonomy to legalise euthanasia and let patients decide whether their situation is
bearable.
Do these arguments for voluntary euthanasia perhaps give
too much weight to individual freedom and autonomy? After
all, we do not allow people free choices on matters like, for
instance, the taking of heroin. This is a restriction of freedom
but, in the view of many, one that can be justified on paternalistic grounds. If preventing people from becoming heroin
199 

addicts is justifiable paternalism, why isn't preventing people
from having themselves killed?
The question is a reasonable one, because respect for individual freedom can be carried too far. John Stuart Mill thought
that the state should never interfere with the individual except
to prevent harm to others. The individual's own good, Mill
thought, is not a proper reason for state intervention. But Mill
may have had too high an opinion of the rationality of a human
being. It may occasionally be right to prevent people from making choices that are obviously not rationally based and that we
can be sure they will later regret. The prohibition of voluntary
euthanasia cannot be justified on paternalistic grounds, however, for voluntary euthanasia is an act for which good reasons
exist. Voluntary euthanasia occurs only when, to the best of
medical knowledge, a person is suffering from an incurable and
painful or extremely distressing condition. In these circumstances one cannot say that to choose to die quickly is obviously
irrational. The strength of the case for voluntary euthanasia lies
in this combination of respect for the preferences, or autonomy,
of those who decide for euthanasia; and the clear rational basis
of the decision itself.
NOT JUSTIFYING INVOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA
Involuntary euthanasia resembles voluntary euthanasia in that
it involves the killing of those capable of consenting to their
own death. It differs in that they do not consent. This difference
is crucial, as the argument of the preceding section shows. All
the four reasons against killing self-conscious beings apply when
the person killed does not choose to die.
Would it ever be possible to justify involuntary euthanasia
on paternalistic grounds, to save someone extreme agony? It
might be possible to imagine a case in which the agony was so
great, and so certain, that the weight of utilitarian considerations
favouring euthanasia override all four reasons against killing
200 

self-conscious beings. Yet to make this decision one would have
to be confident that one can judge when a person's life is so
bad as to be not worth living, better than that person can judge
herself. It is not clear that we are ever justified in having much
confidence in our judgments about whether the life of another
person is, to that person, worth living. That the other person
wishes to go on living is good evidence that her life is worth
living. What better evidence could there be?
The only kind of case in which the paternalistic argument
is at all plausible is one in which the person to be killed
does not realise what agony she will suffer in future, and if
she is not killed now she will have to live through to the
very end. On these grounds one might kill a person who has
- though she does not yet realise it - fallen into the hands
of homicidal sadists who will torture her to death. These cases
are, fortunately, more commonly encountered in fiction than
reality.
If in real life we are unlikely ever to encounter a case of
justifiable involuntary euthanasia, then it may be best to dismiss
from our minds the fanciful cases in which one might imagine
defending it, and treat the rule against involuntary euthanasia
as, for all practical purposes, absolute. Here Hare's distinction
between critical and intuitive levels of moral reasoning (see
Chapter 4), is again relevant. The case described in the preceding
paragraph is one in which, if we were reasoning at the critical
level, we might consider involuntary euthanasia justifiable; but
at the intuitive level, the level of moral reasoning we apply in
our daily lives, we can simply say that euthanasia is only justifiable if those killed either
1 lack the ability to consent to death, because they lack the
capacity to understand the choice between their own continued existence or non-existence; or
2 have the capacity to choose between their own continued life
or death and to make an informed, voluntary, and settled
decision to die.
201 

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE EUTHANASIA
The conclusions we have reached in this chapter will shock a
large number of readers, for they violate one of the most fundamental tenets of Western ethics - the wrongness of killing
innocent human beings. I have already made one attempt to
show that my conclusions are, at least in the area of disabled
infants, a less radical departure from existing practice than one
might suppose. I pointed out that many societies allow a pregnant woman to kill a fetus at a late stage of pregnancy if there
is a significant risk of it being disabled; and since the line between a developed fetus and a newborn infant is not a crucial
moral divide, it is difficult to see why it is worse to kill a newborn
infant known to be disabled. In this section I shall argue that
there is another area of accepted medical practice that is not
intrinsically different from the practices that the arguments of
this chapter would allow.
I have already referred to the birth defect known as spina
bifida, in which the infant is born with an opening in the back,
exposing the spinal cord. Until 1957, most of these infants died
young, but in that year doctors began using a new kind of valve,
to drain off the excess fluid that otherwise accumulates in the
head with this condition. In some hospitals it then became
standard practice to make vigorous efforts to save every spina
bifida infant. The result was that few such infants died - but of
those who survived, many were severely disabled, with gross
paralysis, multiple deformities- of the legs and spine, and no
control of bowel or bladder. Intellectual disabilities were also
common. In short, the existence of these children caused great
difficulty for their families and was often a misery for the children themselves.
After studying the results of this policy of active treatment a
British doctor, John Lorber, proposed that instead of treating
all cases of spina bifida, only those who have the defect in a
mild form should be selected for treatment. (He proposed that
202 

the final decision should be up to the parents, but parents nearly
always accept the recommendations of the doctors.) This principle of selective treatment has now been widely accepted in
many countries and in Britain has been recognised as legitimate
by the Department of Health and Social Security. The result is
that fewer spina bifida children survive beyond infancy, but
those who do survive are, by and large, the ones whose physical
and mental disabilities are relatively minor.
The policy of selection, then, appears to be a desirable one:
but what happens to those disabled infants not selected for
treatment? Lorber does not disguise the fact that in these cases
the hope is that the infant will die soon and without suffering.
It is to achieve this objective that surgical operations and other
forms of active treatment are not undertaken, although pain
and discomfort are as far as possible relieved. If the infant happens to get an infection, the kind of infection that in a normal
infant would be swiftly cleared up with antibiotics, no antibiotics
are given. Since the survival of the infant is not desired, no steps
are taken to prevent a condition, easily curable by ordinary
medical techniques, proving fatal.
All this is, as I have said, accepted medical practice. In articles
in medical journals, doctors have described cases in which they
have allowed infants to die. These cases are not limited to spina
bifida, but include, for instance, babies born with Down's syndrome and other complications. In 1982, the 'Baby Doe' case
brought this practice to the attention of the American public.
'Baby Doe' was the legal pseudonym of a baby born in Bloomington, Indiana, with Down's syndrome and some additional
problems. The most serious of these was that the passage from
the mouth to the stomach - the oesophagus - was not properly
formed. This meant that Baby Doe could not receive nourishment by mouth. The problem could have been repaired by surgery - but in this case the parents, after discussing the situation
with their obstetrician, refused permission for surgery. Without
surgery, Baby Doe would soon die. Baby Doe's father later said
203 

that as a schoolteacher he had worked closely with Down's
syndrome children, and that he and his wife had decided that
it was in the best interests of Baby Doe, and of their family as
a whole (they had two other children), to refuse consent for
the operation. The hospital authorities, uncertain of their legal
position, took the matter to court. Both the local county court
and the Indiana State Supreme Court upheld the parents' right
to refuse consent to surgery. The case attracted national media
attention, and an attempt was made to take it to the U.S. Supreme Court, but before this could happen, Baby Doe died.
One result of the Baby Doe case was that the U.S. government,
headed at the time by President Ronald Reagan, who had come
to power with the backing of the right-wing religious 'Moral
Majority', issued a regulation directing that all infants are to be
given necessary life-saving treatment, irrespective of disability.
But the new regulations were strongly resisted by the American
Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
In court hearings on the regulations, even Dr C. Everett Koop,
Reagan's surgeon-general and the driving force behind the attempt to ensure that all infants should be treated, had to admit
that there were some cases in which he would not provide lifesustaining treatment. Dr Koop mentioned three conditions in
which, he said, life-sustaining treatment was not appropriate:
anencephalic infants (infants born without a brain); infants who
had, usually as a result of extreme prematurity, suffered such
severe bleeding in the brain that they would never be able to
breathe without a respirator and would never be able even to
recognise another person; and infants lacking a major part of
their digestive tract, who could only be kept alive by means of
a drip providing nourishment directly into the bloodstream.
The regulations were eventually accepted only in a watereddown form, allowing some flexibility to doctors. Even so, a
subsequent survey of American paediatricians specialising in the
care of newborn infants showed that 76 percent thought that
the regulations were not necessary, 66 percent considered the
204 

regulations interfered with parents' right to determine what
course of action was in the best interests of their children, and
60 percent believed that the regulations did not allow adequate
consideration of infants' suffering.
In a series of British cases, the courts have accepted the view
that the quality of a child's life is a relevant consideration in
deciding whether life-sustaining treatment should be provided.
In a case called In re B, concerning a baby like Baby Doe, with
Down's syndrome and an intestinal obstruction, the court said
that surgery should be carried out, because the infant's life
would not be 'demonstrably awful'. In another case, Re C, where
the baby had a poorly formed brain combined with severe physical handicaps, the court authorised the paediatric team to refrain from giving life-prolonging treatment. This was also the
course taken in the case of Re Baby J: this infant was born
extremely prematurely, and was blind and deaf and would probably never have been able to speak.
Thus, though many would disagree with Baby Doe's parents
about allowing a Down's syndrome infant to die (because people with Down's syndrome can live enjoyable lives and be warm
and loving individuals), virtually everyone recognises that in
more severe conditions, allowing an infant to die is the only
humane and ethically acceptable course to take. The question
is: if it is right to allow infants to die, why is it wrong to kill
them?
This question has not escaped the notice of the doctors involved. Frequently they answer it by a pious reference to the
nineteenth-century poet, Arthur Clough, who wrote:
Thou shalt not kill; but need'st not strive
Officiously to keep alive.
Unfortunately for those who appeal to Clough's immortal
lines as an authoritative ethical pronouncement, they come
from a biting satire - 'The Latest Decalogue' - the intent of
205 

which is to mock the attitudes described. The opening lines, for
example, are:
Thou shalt have one god only; who
Would be at the expense of two.
No graven images may be
Worshipped except the currency.
So Clough cannot be numbered on the side of those who
think it wrong to kill, but right not to try too hard to keep alive.
Is there, nonetheless, something to be said for this idea? The
view that there is something to be said for it is often termed
'the acts and omissions doctrine'. It holds that there is an important moral distinction between performing an act that has
certain consequences - say, the death of a disabled child - and
omitting to do something that has the same consequences. If
this doctrine is correct, the doctor who gives the child a lethal
injection does wrong; the doctor who omits to give the child
antibiotics, knowing full well that without antibiotics the child
will die, does not.
What grounds are there for accepting the acts and omissions
doctrine? Few champion the doctrine for its own sake, as an
important ethical first principle. It is, rather, an implication of
one view of ethics, of a view that holds that as long as we do
not violate specified moral rules that place determinate moral
obligations upon us, we do all that morality demands of us.
These rules are of the kind made familiar by the Ten Commandments and similar moral codes: Do not kill, Do not lie,
Do not steal, and so on. Characteristically they are formulated
in the negative, so that to obey them it is necessary only to
abstain from the actions they prohibit. Hence obedience can be
demanded of every member of the community.
An ethic consisting of specific duties, prescribed by moral rules
that everyone can be expected to obey, must make a sharp moral
distinction between acts and omissions. Take, for example, the
rule: 'Do not kill.' If this rule is interpreted, as it has been in
206 

the Western tradition, as prohibiting only the taking of innocent
human life, it is not too difficult to avoid overt acts in violation
of it. Few of us are murderers. It is not so easy to avoid letting
innocent humans die. Many people die because of insufficient
food, or poor medical facilities. If we could assist some of them,
but do not do so, we are letting them die. Taking the rule against
killing to apply to omissions would make living in accordance
with it a mark of saintliness or moral heroism, rather than a
minimum required of every morally decent person.
An ethic that judges acts according to whether they do or do
not violate specific moral rules must, therefore, place moral
weight on the distinction between acts and omissions. An ethic
that judges acts by their consequences will not do so, for the
consequences of an act and an omission will often be, in all
significant respects, indistinguishable. For instance, omitting to
give antibiotics to a child with pneumonia may have consequences no less fatal than giving the child a lethal injection.
Which approach is right? I have argued for a consequentialist
approach to ethics. The acts/omissions issue poses the choice
between these two basic approaches in an unusually clear and
direct way. What we need to do is imagine two parallel situations differing only in that in one a person performs an act
resulting in the death of another human being, while in the
other she omits to do something, with the same result. Here is
a description of a relatively common situation, taken from an
essay by Sir Gustav Nossal, an eminent Australian medical
researcher:
An old lady of 83 has been admitted [to a nursing home for the
aged] because her increasing degree of mental confusion has
made it impossible for her to stay in her own home, and there
is no one willing and able to look after her. Over three years,
her condition deteriorates. She loses the ability to speak, requires
to be fed, and becomes incontinent. Finally, she cannot sit in an
armchair any longer, and is confined permanently to bed. One
day, she contracts pneumonia.
207 

In a patient who was enjoying a reasonable quality of life, pneumonia would be routinely treated with antibiotics. Should this
patient be given antibiotics? Nossal continues:
The relatives are contacted, and the matron of the nursing home
tells them that she and the doctor she uses most frequently have
worked out a loose arrangement for cases of this type. With
advanced senile dementia, they treat the first three infections
with antibiotics, and after that, mindful of the adage that 'pneumonia is the old person's friend', they let nature take its course.
The matron emphasises that if the relatives desire, all infections
can be vigorously treated. The relatives agree with the rule of
thumb. The patient dies of a urinary tract infection six months
later.
This patient died when she did as a result of a deliberate omission. Many people would think that this omission was welljustified. They might question whether it would not have been
better to omit treatment even for the initial occurrence of pneumonia. There is, after all, no moral magic about the number
three. Would it also have been justifiable, at the time of the
omission, to give an injection that would bring about the patient's death in a peaceful way?
Comparing these two possible ways of bringing about a patient's death at a particular time, is it reasonable to hold that
the doctor who gives the injection is a murderer who deserves
to go to jail, while the doctor who decides not to administer
antibiotics is practising good and compassionate medicine? That
may be what courts of law would say, but surely it is an untenable distinction. In both cases, the outcome is the death of
the patient. In both cases, the doctor knows that this will be
the result, and decides what she will do on the basis of this
knowledge, because she judges this result to be better than the
alternative. In both cases the doctor must take responsibility for
her decision - it would not be correct for the doctor who decided
not to provide antibiotics to say that she was not responsible
for the patient's death because she did nothing. Doing nothing
208 

in this situation is itself a deliberate choice and one cannot
escape responsibility for its consequences.
One might say, of course, that the doctor who withholds
antibiotics does not kill the patient, she merely allows the patient
to die; but one must then answer the further question why
killing is wrong, and letting die is not. The answer that most
advocates of the distinction give is simply that there is a moral
rule against killing innocent human beings and none against
allowing them to die. This answer treats a conventionally accepted moral rule as if it were beyond questioning; it does not
go on to ask whether we should have a moral rule against killing
(but not against allowing to die). But we have already seen that
the conventionally accepted principle of the sanctity of human
life is untenable. The moral rules that prohibit killing, but accept
'letting die' cannot be taken for granted either.
Reflecting on these cases leads us to the conclusion that there
is no intrinsic moral difference between killing and allowing to
die. That is, there is no difference which depends solely on the
distinction between an act and an omission. (This does not mean
that all cases of allowing to die are morally equivalent to killing.
Other factors - extrinsic factors - will sometimes be relevant.
This will be discussed further in Chapter 8.) Allowing to die -
sometimes called 'passive euthanasia' - is already accepted as
a humane and proper course of action in certain cases. If there
is no intrinsic moral difference between killing and allowing to
die, active euthanasia should also be accepted as humane and
proper in certain circumstances.
Others have suggested that the difference between withholding treatment necessary to prolong life, and giving a lethal injection, lies in the intention with which the two are done. Those
who take this view resort to the 'doctrine of double effect', a
doctrine widely held among Roman Catholic moral theologians
and moral philosophers, to argue that one action (for example,
refraining from life-sustaining treatment) may have two effects
(in this case, not causing additional suffering to the patient, and
209 

shortening the patient's life). They then argue that as long as
the directly intended effect is the beneficial one that does not
violate an absolute moral rule, the action is permissible. Though
we foresee that our action (or omission) will result in the death
of the patient, this is merely an unwanted side-effect. But the
distinction between directly intended effect and side-effect is a
contrived one. We cannot avoid responsibility simply by directing our intention to one effect rather than another. If we
foresee both effects, we must take responsibility for the foreseen
effects of what we do. We often want to do something, but
cannot do it because of its other, unwanted consequences. For
example, a chemical company might want to get rid of toxic
waste in the most economical manner, by dumping it in the
nearest river. Would we allow the executives of the company
to say that all they directly intended was to improve the efficiency of the factory, thus promoting employment and keeping
down the cost of living? Would we regard the pollution as
excusable because it is merely an unwanted side-effect of furthering these worthy objectives?
Obviously the defenders of the doctrine of double effect would
not accept such an excuse. In rejecting it, however, they would
have to rely upon a judgment that the cost - the polluted river
- is disproportionate to the gains. Here a consequentialist judgment lurks behind the doctrine of double effect. The same is
true when the doctrine is used in medical care. Normally, saving
life takes precedence over relieving pain. If in the case of a
particular patient it does not, this can only be because we have
judged that the patient's prospects for a future life of acceptable
quality are so poor that in this case relieving suffering can take
precedence. This is, in other words, not a decision based on
acceptance of the sanctity of human life, but a decision based
on a disguised quality of life judgment.
Equally unsatisfactory is the common appeal to a distinction
between 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary' means of treatment,
coupled with the belief that it is not obligatory to provide ex210 

traordinary means. Together with my colleague, Helga Kuhse,
I carried out a survey of paediatricians and obstetricians in Australia and found that they had remarkable ideas about what
constituted 'ordinary' and what 'extraordinary' means. Some
even thought that the use of antibiotics - the cheapest, simplest,
and most common medical procedure - could be extraordinary.
The reason for this range of views is easy to find. When one
looks at the justifications given by moral theologians and philosophers for the distinction, it turns out that what is 'ordinary'
in one situation can become 'extraordinary' in another. For
example, in the famous case of Karen Ann Quinlan, the young
New Jersey woman who was in a coma for ten years before
she died, a Roman Catholic bishop testified that the use of a
respirator was 'extraordinary' and hence optional because Quinlan had no hope of recovery from the coma. Obviously, if doctors
had thought that Quinlan was likely to recover, the use of the
respirator would not have been optional, and would have been
declared 'ordinary'. Again, it is the quality of life of the patient
(and where resources are limited and could be used more effectively to save lives elsewhere, the cost of the treatment) that
is determining whether a given form of treatment is ordinary
or extraordinary, and therefore is to be provided or not. Those
who appeal to this distinction are cloaking their consequentialist
views in the robe of an absolutist ethic; but the robe is worn
out, and the disguise is now transparent.
So it is not possible to appeal to either the doctrine of double
effect or the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary
means in order to show that allowing a patient to die is morally
different from actively helping a patient to die. Indeed, because
of extrinsic differences - especially differences in the time it
takes for death to occur - active euthanasia may be the only
humane and morally proper course. Passive euthanasia can be
a slow process. In an article in the British Medical Journal, John
Lorber has charted the fate of twenty-five infants born with
spina bifida on whom it had been decided, in view of the poor
211 

prospects for a worthwhile life, not to operate. It will be recalled
that Lorber freely grants that the object of not treating infants
is that they should die soon and painlessly. Yet of the twentyfive untreated infants, fourteen were still alive after one month,
and seven after three months. In Lorber's sample, all the infants
died within nine months, but this cannot be guaranteed, or at
least, cannot be guaranteed without stepping over the fine line
between active and passive euthanasia. (Lorber's opponents
have claimed that the untreated infants under his care all die
because they are given sedatives and fed only on demand. Sleepy
babies do not have healthy appetites.) An Australian clinic following Lorber's approach to spina bifida found that of seventynine untreated infants, five survived for more than two years.
For both the infants, and their families, this must be a longdrawn out ordeal. It is also (although in a society with a reasonable level of affluence this should not be the primary consideration) a considerable burden on the hospital staff and the
community's medical resources.
Consider, to take another example, infants born with Down's
syndrome and a blockage in the digestive system which, if not
removed, will make it impossible for the baby to eat. Like 'Baby
Doe', these infants may be allowed to die. Yet the blockage can
be removed and has nothing to do with the degree of intellectual
disability the child will have. Moreover, the death resulting from
the failure to operate in these circumstances is, though sure,
neither swift nor painless. The infant dies from dehydration or
hunger. Baby Doe took about five days to die, and in other
recorded instances of this practice, it has taken up to two weeks
for death to come.
It is interesting, in this context, to think again of our earlier
argument that membership of the species Homo sapiens does
not entitle a being to better treatment than a being at a similar
mental level who is a member of a different species. We could
also have said - except that it seemed too obvious to need saying
- that membership of the species Homo sapiens is not a reason
212 

for giving a being worse treatment than a member of a different
species. Yet in respect of euthanasia, this needs to be said. We
do not doubt that it is right to shoot badly injured or sick animals
if they are in pain and their chances of recovery are negligible.
To 'allow nature to take its course', withholding treatment but
refusing to kill, would obviously be wrong. It is only our misplaced respect for the doctrine of the sanctity of human life that
prevents us from seeing that what it is obviously wrong to do
to a horse, it is equally wrong to do to a disabled infant.
To summarise: passive ways of ending life result in a drawnout death. They introduce irrelevant factors (a blockage in the
intestine, or an easily curable infection) into the selection of
those who shall die. If we are able to admit that our objective
is a swift and painless death we should not leave it up to chance
to determine whether this objective is achieved. Having chosen
death we should ensure that it comes in the best possible way.
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE: FROM EUTHANASIA
TO GENOCIDE?
Before we leave this topic we must consider an objection that
looms so large in the anti-euthanasia literature that it merits a
section to itself. It is, for instance, the reason why John Lorber
rejects active euthanasia. Lorber has written:
I wholly disagree with euthanasia. Though it is fully logical, and
in expert and conscientious hands it could be the most humane
way of dealing with such a situation, legalizing euthanasia would
be a most dangerous weapon in the hands of the State or ignorant
or unscrupulous individuals. One does not have to go far back
in history to know what crimes can be committed if euthanasia
were legalized.
Would euthanasia be the first step down a slippery slope? In
the absence of prominent moral footholds to check our descent,
would we slide all the way down into the abyss of state terror
and mass murder? The experience of Nazism, to which Lorber
213 

no doubt is referring, has often been used as an illustration of
what could follow acceptance of euthanasia. Here is a more
specific example, from an article by another doctor, Leo
Alexander:
Whatever proportions [Nazi] crimes finally assumed, it became
evident to all who investigated them that they had started from
small beginnings. The beginnings at first were merely a subtle
shift in emphasis in the basic attitude of the physicians. It started
with the acceptance of the attitude, basic in the euthanasia movement, that there is such a thing as life not worthy to be lived.
This attitude in its early stages concerned itself merely with the
severely and chronically sick. Gradually the sphere of those to
be included in the category was enlarged to encompass the socially unproductive, the ideologically unwanted, the racially unwanted and finally all non-Germans. But it is important to realize
that the infinitely small wedged-in lever from which this entire
ttend of mind received its impetus was the attitude toward the
nonrehabilitable sick.
Alexander singles out the Nazis' so-called euthanasia program
as the root of all the horrendous crimes the Nazis later committed, because that program implied 'that there is such a thing
as life not worthy to be lived'. Lorber could hardly agree with
Alexander on this, since his recommended procedure of not
treating selected infants is based on exactly this judgment. Although people sometimes talk as if we should never judge a
human life to be not worth living, there are times when such
a judgment is obviously correct. A life of physical suffering,
unredeemed by any form of pleasure or by a minimal level of
self-consciousness, is not worth living. Surveys undertaken by
health care economists in which people are asked how much
they value being alive in certain states of health, regularly find
that people give some states a negative value - that is, they
indicate that they would prefer to be dead than to survive in
that condition. Apparently, the life of the elderly woman described by Sir Gustav Nossal was, in the opinion of the matron
of the nursing home, the doctor, and the relatives, not worth
214 

living. If we can set criteria for deciding who is to be allowed
to die and who is to be given treatment, then why should it be
wrong to set criteria, perhaps the same criteria, for deciding
w ho should be killed?
So it is not the attitude that some lives are not worth living
that marks out the Nazis from normal people who do not commit mass murder. What then is it? Is it that they went beyond
passive euthanasia, and practised active euthanasia? Many,
like Lorber, worry about the power that a program of active
euthanasia could place in the hands of an unscrupulous government. This worry is not negligible, but should not be
exaggerated. Unscrupulous governments already have within
their power more plausible means of getting rid of their opponents than euthanasia administered by doctors on medical
grounds. 'Suicides' can be arranged. 'Accidents' can occur. If
necessary, assassins can be hired. Our best defence against such
possibilities is to do everything possible to keep our government
democratic, open, and in the hands of people who would not
seriously wish to kill their opponents. Once the wish is serious
enough, governments will find a way, whether euthanasia is
legal or not.
In fact the Nazis did not have a euthanasia program, in the
proper sense of the word. Their so-called euthanasia program
was not motivated by concern for the suffering of those killed.
If it had been, why would the Nazis have kept their operations
secret, deceived relatives about the cause of death of those killed,
and exempted from the program certain privileged classes, such
as veterans of the armed services, or relatives of the euthanasia
staff? Nazi 'euthanasia' was never voluntary, and often was
involuntary rather than non-voluntary. 'Doing away with useless mouths' - a phrase used by those in charge - gives a better
idea of the objectives of the program than 'mercy-killing'. Both
racial origin and ability to work were among the factors considered in the selection of patients to be killed. It was the Nazi
belief in the importance of maintaining a pure Aryan Volk - a
215 

somewhat mystical entity that was thought of as more important
than mere individuals lives - that made both the so-called euthanasia program and later the entire holocaust possible. Proposals for the legalisation of euthanasia, in contrast, are based
on respect for autonomy and the goal of avoiding pointless
suffering.
This essential difference in the aims of Nazi 'euthanasia' and
modern proposals may be granted, but the slippery slope argument could still be defended as a way of suggesting that the
present strict rule against the direct killing of innocent human
beings serves a useful purpose. However arbitrary and unjustifiable the distinctions between human and non-human, fetus
and infant, killing and allowing to die may be, the rule against
direct killing of innocent humans at least marks a workable line.
The distinction between an infant whose life may be worth
living, and one whose life definitely is not, is much more difficult
to draw. Perhaps people who see that certain kinds of human
beings are killed in certain circumstances may go on to conclude
that it is not wrong to kill others not very different from the
first kind. So will the boundary of acceptable killing be pushed
gradually back? In the absence of any logical stopping place,
will the outcome be the loss of all respect for human life?
If our laws were altered so that anyone could carry out an
act of euthanasia, the absence of a clear line between those who
might justifiably be killed and those who might not would pose
a real danger; but that is not what advocates of euthanasia
propose. If acts of euthanasia could only be carried out by a
member of the medical profession, with the concurrence of a
second doctor, it is not likely that the propensity to kill would
spread unchecked throughout the community. Doctors already
have a good deal of power over life and death, through their
ability to withhold treatment. There has been no suggestion that
doctors who begin by allowing severely disabled infants to die
from pneumonia will move on to withhold antibiotics from
racial minorities or political extremists. In fact legalising eu216 

thanasia might well act as a check on the power of doctors since
it would bring into the open and under the scrutiny of another
doctor what some doctors now do on their own initiative and
in secret.
There is, anyway, little historical evidence to suggest that a
permissive attitude towards the killing of one category of human
beings leads to a breakdown of restrictions against killing other
humans. Ancient Greeks regularly killed or exposed infants, but
appear to have been at least as scrupulous about taking the lives
of their fellow-citizens as medieval Christians or modern Americans. In traditional Eskimo societies it was the custom for a
m an to kill his elderly parents, but the murder of a normal
healthy adult was almost unheard of. I mention these practices
not to suggest that they should be imitated, but only to indicate
that lines can be drawn at places different from where we now
draw them. If these societies could separate human beings into
different categories without transferring their attitudes from one
group to another, we with our more sophisticated legal systems
and greater medical knowledge should be able to do the same.
All of this is not to deny that departing from the traditional
sanctity-of-life ethic carries with it a very small but nevertheless
finite risk of unwanted consequences. Against this risk we must
balance the tangible harm to which the traditional ethic gives
rise - harm to those whose misery is needlessly prolonged. We
must also ask if the widespread acceptance of abortion and
passive euthanasia has not already revealed flaws in the traditional ethic that make it a weak defence against those who
lack respect for individual lives. A sounder, if less clear-cut,
ethic may in the long run provide a firmer ground for resisting
unjustifiable killing.

RICH AND POOR
SOME FACTS ABOUT POVERTY
I
N the discussion of euthanasia in Chapter 7, we questioned
the distinction between killing and allowing to die, concluding that it is of no intrinsic ethical significance. This conclusion has implications that go far beyond euthanasia.
Consider these facts: by the most cautious estimates, 400
million people lack the calories, protein, vitamins and minerals
needed to sustain their bodies and minds in a healthy state.
Millions are constantly hungry; others suffer from deficiency
diseases and from infections they would be able to resist on a
better diet. Children are the worst affected. According to one
study, 14 million children under five die every year from the
combined effects of malnutrition and infection. In some districts
half the children bom can be expected to die before their fifth
birthday.
Nor is lack of food the only hardship of the poor. To give a
broader picture, Robert McNamara, when president of the
World Bank, suggested the term 'absolute poverty'. The poverty
we are familiar with in industrialised nations is relative poverty
- meaning that some citizens are poor, relative to the wealth
enjoyed by their neighbours. People living in relative poverty
in Australia might be quite comfortably off by comparison with
pensioners in Britain, and British pensioners are not poor in
comparison with the poverty that exists in Mali or Ethiopia.
Absolute poverty, on the other hand, is poverty by any standard.
In McNamara's words:
218 

Poverty at the absolute level... is life at the very margin of existence. The absolute poor are severely deprived human beings
struggling to survive in a set of squalid and degraded circumstances almost beyond the power of our sophisticated imaginations and privileged circumstances to conceive.
Compared to those fortunate enough to live in developed countries, individuals in the poorest nations have:
An infant mortality rate eight times higher
A life expectancy one-third lower
An adult literacy rate 60 per cent less
A nutritional level, for one out of every two in the population,
below acceptable standards;
And for millions of infants, less protein than is sufficient to permit
optimum development of the brain.
McNamara has summed up absolute poverty as 'a condition of
life so characterised by malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, squalid
surroundings, high infant mortality and low life expectancy as
to be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency'.
Absolute poverty is, as McNamara has said, responsible for
the loss of countless lives, especially among infants and young
children. When absolute poverty does not cause death, it still
causes misery of a kind not often seen in the affluent nations.
Malnutrition in young children stunts both physical and mental
development. According to the United Nations Development
Programme, 180 million children under the age of five suffer
from serious malnutrition. Millions of people on poor diets suffer from deficiency diseases, like goitre, or blindness caused by
a lack of vitamin A. The food value of what the poor eat is
further reduced by parasites such as hookworm and ringworm,
which are endemic in conditions of poor sanitation and health
education.
Death and disease apart, absolute poverty remains a miserable
condition of life, with inadequate food, shelter, clothing, sanitation, health services and education. The Worldwatch Institute
219 

estimates that as many as 1.2 billion people - or 23 per cent of
the world's population - live in absolute poverty. For the purposes of this estimate, absolute poverty is defined as "the lack
of sufficient income in cash or kind to meet the most basic
biological needs for food, clothing, and shelter." Absolute poverty is probably the principal cause of human misery today.
SOME FACTS ABOUT WEALTH
This is the background situation, the situation that prevails
on our planet all the time. It does not make headlines. People
died from malnutrition and related diseases yesterday, and
more will die tomorrow. The occasional droughts, cyclones,
earthquakes, and floods that take the lives of tens of thousands
in one place and at one time are more newsworthy. They add
greatly to the total amount of human suffering; but it is wrong
to assume that when there are no major calamities reported,
all is well.
The problem is not that the world cannot produce enough to
feed and shelter its people. People in the poor countries consume, on average, 180 kilos of grain a year, while North Americans average around 900 kilos. The difference is caused by the
fact that in the rich countries we feed most of our grain to
animals, converting it into meat, milk, and eggs. Because this
is a highly inefficient process, people in rich countries are responsible for the consumption of far more food than those in
poor countries who eat few animal products. If we stopped
feeding animals on grains and soybeans, the amount of food
saved would - if distributed to those who need it - be more
than enough to end hunger throughout the world.
These facts about animal food do not mean that we can easily
solve the world food problem by cutting down on animal products, but they show that the problem is essentially one of distribution rather than production. The world does produce
enough food. Moreover, the poorer nations themselves could
220 

produce far more if they made more use of improved agricultural
techniques.
So why are people hungry? Poor people cannot afford to buy
grain grown by farmers in the richer nations. Poor farmers cannot afford to buy improved seeds, or fertilisers, or the machinery
needed for drilling wells and pumping water. Only by transferring some of the wealth of the rich nations to the poor can
the situation be changed.
That this wealth exists is clear. Against the picture of absolute
poverty that McNamara has painted, one might pose a picture
of 'absolute affluence'. Those who are absolutely affluent are
not necessarily affluent by comparison with their neighbours,
but they are affluent by any reasonable definition of human
needs. This means that they have more income than they need
to provide themselves adequately with all the basic necessities
of life. After buying (either directly or through their taxes) food,
shelter, clothing, basic health services, and education, the absolutely affluent are still able to spend money on luxuries. The
absolutely affluent choose their food for the pleasures of the
palate, not to stop hunger; they buy new clothes to look good,
not to keep warm; they move house to be in a better neighbourhood or have a playroom for the children, not to keep out
the rain; and after all this there is still money to spend on stereo
systems, video-cameras, and overseas holidays.
At this stage I am making no ethical judgments about absolute
affluence, merely pointing out that it exists. Its defining characteristic is a significant amount of income above the level necessary to provide for the basic human needs of oneself and one's
dependents. By this standard, the majority of citizens of Western
Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the
oil-rich Middle Eastern states are all absolutely affluent. To
quote McNamara once more:
The average citizen of a developed country enjoys wealth beyond
the wildest dreams of the one billion people in countries with
221 

per capita incomes under $200.' These, therefore, are the countries - and individuals - who have wealth that they could, without threatening their own basic welfare, transfer to the absolutely
poor.
At present, very little is being transferred. Only Sweden, the
Netherlands, Norway, and some of the oil-exporting Arab states
have reached the modest target, set by the United Nations, of
0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP). Britain gives 0.31
per cent of its GNP in official development assistance and a
small additional amount in unofficial aid from voluntary organisations. The total comes to about £2 per month per person,
and compares with 5.5 per cent of GNP spent on alcohol, and
3 per cent on tobacco. Other, even wealthier nations, give little
more: Germany gives 0.41 per cent and Japan 0.32 per cent.
The United States gives a mere 0.15 per cent of its GNP.
THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF MURDER?
If these are the facts, we cannot avoid concluding that by not
giving more than we do, people in rich countries are allowing
those in poor countries to suffer from absolute poverty, with
consequent malnutrition, ill health, and death. This is not a
conclusion that applies only to governments. It applies to each
absolutely affluent individual, for each of us has the opportunity
to do something about the situation; for instance, to give our
time or money to voluntary organisations like Oxfam, Care,
War on Want, Freedom from Hunger, Community Aid Abroad,
and so on. If, then, allowing someone to die is not intrinsically
different from killing someone, it would seem that we are all
murderers.
Is this verdict too harsh? Many will reject it as self-evidently
absurd. They would sooner take it as showing that allowing to
die cannot be equivalent to killing than as showing that living
in an affluent style without contributing to an overseas aid
agency is ethically equivalent to going over to Ethiopia and
222 

shooting a few peasants. And no doubt, put as bluntly as that,
the verdict is too harsh.
There are several significant differences between spending
money on luxuries instead of using it to save lives, and deliberately shooting people.
First, the motivation will normally be different. Those who
deliberately shoot others go out of their way to kill; they presumably want their victims dead, from malice, sadism, or some
equally unpleasant motive. A person who buys a new stereo
system presumably wants to enhance her enjoyment of music
- not in itself a terrible thing. At worst, spending money on
luxuries instead of giving it away indicates selfishness and indifference to the sufferings of others, characteristics that may
be undesirable but are not comparable with actual malice or
similar motives.
Second, it is not difficult for most of us to act in accordance
with a rule against killing people: it is, on the other hand, very
difficult to obey a rule that commands us to save all the lives
we can. To live a comfortable, or even luxurious life it is not
necessary to kill anyone; but it is necessary to allow some to
die whom we might have saved, for the money that we need
to live comfortably could have been given away. Thus the duty
to avoid killing is much easier to discharge completely than the
duty to save. Saving every life we could would mean cutting
our standard of living down to the bare essentials needed to
keep us alive.1
 To discharge this duty completely would require
a degree of moral heroism utterly different from that required
by mere avoidance of killing.
1 Strictly, we would need to cut down to the minimum level compatible with
earning the income which, after providing for our needs, left us most to give
away. Thus if my present position earns me, say, $40,000 a year, but requires
me to spend $5,000 a year on dressing respectably and maintaining a car, I
cannot save more people by giving away the car and clothes if that will mean
taking a job that, although it does not involve me in these expenses, earns
me only $20,000.
223 

A third difference is the greater certainty of the outcome of
shooting when compared with not giving aid. If I point a loaded
gun at someone at close range and pull the trigger, it is virtually
certain that the person will be killed; whereas the money that
I could give might be spent on a project that turns out to be
unsuccessful and helps no one.
Fourth, when people are shot there are identifiable individuals who have been harmed. We can point to them and to their
grieving families. When I buy my stereo system, I cannot know
who my money would have saved if I had given it away. In a
time of famine I may see dead bodies and grieving families on
television reports, and I might not doubt that my money would
have saved some of them; even then it is impossible to point
to a body and say that had I not bought the stereo, that person
would have survived.
Fifth, it might be said that the plight of the hungry is not my
doing, and so I cannot be held responsible for it. The starving
would have been starving if I had never existed. If I kill, however, I am responsible for my victims' deaths, for those people
would not have died if I had not killed them.
These differences need not shake our previous conclusion that
there is no intrinsic difference between killing and allowing to
die. They are extrinsic differences, that is, differences normally
but not necessarily associated with the distinction between killing and allowing to die. We can imagine cases in which someone
allows another to die for malicious or sadistic reasons; we can
imagine a world in which there are so few people needing
assistance, and they are so easy to assist, that our duty not to
allow people to die is as easily discharged as our duty not to
kill; we can imagine situations in which the outcome of not
helping is as sure as shooting; we can imagine cases in which
we can identify the person we allow to die. We can even imagine
a case of allowing to die in which, if I had not existed, the
person would not have died - for instance, a case in which if
I had not been in a position to help (though I don't help)
224 

someone else would have been in my position and would have
helped.
Our previous discussion of euthanasia illustrates the extrinsic
nature of these differences, for they do not provide a basis for
distinguishing active from passive euthanasia. If a doctor decides, in consultation with the parents, not to operate on - and
thus to allow to die - a Down's syndrome infant with an intestinal blockage, her motivation will be similar to that of a
doctor who gives a lethal injection rather than allow the infant
to die. No extraordinary sacrifice or moral heroism will be required in either case. Not operating will just as certainly end in
death as administering the injection. Allowing to die does have
an identifiable victim. Finally, it may well be that the doctor is
personally responsible for the death of the infant she decides
not to operate upon, since she may know that if she had not
taken this case, other doctors in the hospital would have
operated.
Nevertheless, euthanasia is a special case, and very different
from allowing people to starve to death. (The major difference
being that when euthanasia is justifiable, death is a good thing.)
The extrinsic differences that normally mark off killing and allowing to die do explain why we normally regard killing as much
worse than allowing to die.
To explain our conventional ethical attitudes is not to justify
them. Do the five differences not only explain, but also justify,
our attitudes? Let us consider them one by one:
1. Take the lack of an identifiable victim first. Suppose that
I am a travelling salesperson, selling tinned food, and I learn
that a batch of tins contains a contaminant, the known effect
of which, when consumed, is to double the risk that the consumer will die from stomach cancer. Suppose I continue to sell
the tins. My decision may have no identifiable victims. Some
of those who eat the food will die from cancer. The proportion
of consumers dying in this way will be twice that of the community at large, but who among the consumers died because
225 

they ate what I sold, and who would have contracted the disease
anyway? It is impossible to tell; but surely this impossibility
makes my decision no less reprehensible than it would have
been had the contaminant had more readily detectable, though
equally fatal, effects.
2. The lack of certainty that by giving money I could save a
life does reduce the wrongness of not giving, by comparison
with deliberate killing; but it is insufficient to show that not
giving is acceptable conduct. The motorist who speeds through
pedestrian crossings, heedless of anyone who might be on them,
is not a murderer. She may never actually hit a pedestrian; yet
what she does is very wrong indeed.
3. The notion of responsibility for acts rather than omissions
is more puzzling. On the one hand, we feel ourselves to be
under a greater obligation to help those whose misfortunes we
have caused. (It is for this reason that advocates of overseas aid
often argue that Western nations have created the poverty of
third world nations, through forms of economic exploitation
that go back to the colonial system.) On the other hand, any
consequentialist would insist that we are responsible for all the
consequences of our actions, and if a consequence of my spending money on a luxury item is that someone dies, I am responsible for that death. It is true that the person would have
died even if I had never existed, but what is the relevance of
that? The fact is that I do exist, and the consequentialist will
say that our responsibilities derive from the world as it is, not
as it might have been.
One way of making sense of the non-consequentialist view
of responsibility is by basing it on a theory of rights of the kind
proposed by John Locke or, more recently, Robert Nozick. If
everyone has a right to life, and this right is a right against others
w ho might threaten my life, but not a right to assistance from
others when my life is in danger, then we can understand the
feeling that we are responsible for acting to kill but not for
226 

omitting to save. The former violates the rights of others, the
latter does not.
Should we accept such a theory of rights? If we build up our
theory of rights by imagining, as Locke and Nozick do, individuals living independently from each other in a 'state of nature',
it may seem natural to adopt a conception of rights in which
as long as each leaves the other alone, no rights are violated. I
might, on this view, quite properly have maintained my independent existence if I had wished to do so. So if I do not make
you any worse off than you would have been if I had had
nothing at all to do with you, how can I have violated your
rights? But why start from such an unhistorical, abstract and
ultimately inexplicable idea as an independent individual? Our
ancestors were - like other primates - social beings long before
they were human beings, and could not have developed the
abilities and capacities of human beings if they had not been
social beings first. In any case, we are not, now, isolated individuals. So why should we assume that rights must be restricted
to rights against interference? We might, instead, adopt the view
that taking rights to life seriously is incompatible with standing
by and watching people die when one could easily save them.
4. What of the difference in motivation? That a person does
not positively wish for the death of another lessens the severity
of the blame she deserves; but not by as much as our present
attitudes to giving aid suggest. The behaviour of the speeding
motorist is again comparable, for such motorists usually have
no desire at all to kill anyone. They merely enjoy speeding and
are indifferent to the consequences. Despite their lack of malice,
those who kill with cars deserve not only blame but also severe
punishment.
5. Finally, the fact that to avoid killing people is normally not
difficult, whereas to save all one possibly could save is heroic,
must make an important difference to our attitude to failure to
do what the respective principles demand. Not to kill is a min227 

imum standard of acceptable conduct we can require of everyone; to save all one possibly could is not something that can
realistically be required, especially not in societies accustomed
to giving as little as ours do. Given the generally accepted standards, people who give, say, $1,000 a year to an overseas aid
organisation are more aptly praised for above average generosity
than blamed for giving less than they might. The appropriateness
of praise and blame is, however, a separate issue from the rightness or wrongness of actions. The former evaluates the agent:
the latter evaluates the action. Perhaps many people who give
$1,000 really ought to give at least $5,000, but to blame them
for not giving more could be counterproductive. It might make
them feel that what is required is too demanding, and if one is
going to be blamed anyway, one might as well not give anything
at all.
(That an ethic that put saving all one possibly can on the
same footing as not killing would be an ethic for saints or heroes
should not lead us to assume that the alternative must be an
ethic that makes it obligatory not to kill, but puts us under no
obligation to save anyone. There are positions in between these
extremes, as we shall soon see.)
Here is a summary of the five differences that normally exist
between killing and allowing to die, in the context of absolute
poverty and overseas aid. The lack of an identifiable victim is
of no moral significance, though it may play an important role
in explaining our attitudes. The idea that we are directly responsible for those we kill, but not for those we do not help,
depends on a questionable notion of responsibility and may
need to be based on a controversial theory of rights. Differences
in certainty and motivation are ethically significant, and show
that not aiding the poor is not to be condemned as murdering
them; it could, however, be on a par with killing someone as
a result of reckless driving, which is serious enough. Finally the
difficulty of completely discharging the duty of saving all one
possibly can makes it inappropriate to blame those who fall
228 

short of this target as we blame those who kill; but this does
not show that the act itself is less serious. Nor does it indicate
anything about those who, far from saving all they possibly can,
make no effort to save anyone.
These conclusions suggest a new approach. Instead of attempting to deal with the contrast between affluence and poverty by comparing not saving with deliberate killing, let us
consider afresh whether we have an obligation to assist those
whose lives are in danger, and if so, how this obligation applies
to the present world situation.
THE OBLIGATION TO ASSIST
The Argument for an Obligation to Assist
The path from the library at my university to the humanities
lecture theatre passes a shallow ornamental pond. Suppose that
on my way to give a lecture I notice that a small child has fallen
in and is in danger of drowning. Would anyone deny that I
ought to wade in and pull the child out? This will mean getting
my clothes muddy and either cancelling my lecture or delaying
it until I can find something dry to change into; but compared
with the avoidable death of a child this is insignificant.
A plausible principle that would support the judgment that I
ought to pull the child out is this: if it is in our power to prevent
something very bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing
anything of comparable moral significance, we ought to do it.
This principle seems uncontroversial. It will obviously win the
assent of consequentialists; but non-consequentialists should
accept it too, because the injunction to prevent what is bad
applies only when nothing comparably significant is at stake.
Thus the principle cannot lead to the kinds of actions of which
non-consequentialists strongly disapprove - serious violations
of individual rights, injustice, broken promises, and so on. If
non-consequentialists regard any of these as comparable in
229 

moral significance to the bad thing that is to be prevented, they
will automatically regard the principle as not applying in those
cases in which the bad thing can only be prevented by violating
rights, doing injustice, breaking promises, or whatever else is
at stake. Most non-consequentialists hold that we ought to prevent what is bad and promote what is good. Their dispute with
consequentialists lies in their insistence that this is not the sole
ultimate ethical principle: that it is an ethical principle is not
denied by any plausible ethical theory.
Nevertheless the uncontroversial appearance of the principle
that we ought to prevent what is bad when we can do so without
sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance is deceptive. If it were taken seriously and acted upon, our lives and
our world would be fundamentally changed. For the principle
applies, not just to rare situations in which one can save a child
from a pond, but to the everyday situation in which we can
assist those living in absolute poverty. In saying this I assume
that absolute poverty, with its hunger and malnutrition, lack of
shelter, illiteracy, disease, high infant mortality, and low life
expectancy, is a bad thing. And I assume that it is within the
power of the affluent to reduce absolute poverty, without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance. If these two
assumptions and the principle we have been discussing are correct, we have an obligation to help those in absolute poverty
that is no less strong than our obligation to rescue a drowning
child from a pond. Not to help would be wrong, whether or
not it is intrinsically equivalent to killing. Helping is not, as
conventionally thought, a charitable act that it is praiseworthy
to do, but not wrong to omit; it is something that everyone
ought to do.
This is the argument for an obligation to assist. Set out more
formally, it would look like this.
First premise: If we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, we ought to do it.
230 

Second premise: Absolute poverty is bad.
Third premise: There is some absolute poverty we can prevent
without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance.
Conclusion: We ought to prevent some absolute poverty.
The first premise is the substantive moral premise on which
the argument rests, and I have tried to show that it can be
accepted by people who hold a variety of ethical positions.
The second premise is unlikely to be challenged. Absolute
poverty is, as McNamara put it, 'beneath any reasonable definition of human decency' and it would be hard to find a plausible ethical view that did not regard it as a bad thing.
The third premise is more controversial, even though it is
cautiously framed. It claims only that some absolute poverty
can be prevented without the sacrifice of anything of comparable
moral significance. It thus avoids the objection that any aid I
can give is just 'drops in the ocean' for the point is not whether
my personal contribution will make any noticeable impression
on world poverty as a whole (of course it won't) but whether
it will prevent some poverty. This is all the argument needs to
sustain its conclusion, since the second premise says that any
absolute poverty is bad, and not merely the total amount of
absolute poverty. If without sacrificing anything of comparable
moral significance we can provide just one family with the
means to raise itself out of absolute poverty, the third premise
is vindicated.
I have left the notion of moral significance unexamined in
order to show that the argument does not depend on any specific
values or ethical principles. I think the third premise is true for
most people living in industrialised nations, on any defensible
view of what is morally significant. Our affluence means that
we have income we can dispose of without giving up the basic
necessities of life, and we can use this income to reduce absolute
poverty. Just how much we will think ourselves obliged to give
up will depend on what we consider to be of comparable moral
231 

significance to the poverty we could prevent: stylish clothes,
expensive dinners, a sophisticated stereo system, overseas holidays, a (second?) car, a larger house, private schools for our
children, and so on. For a utilitarian, none of these is likely to
be of comparable significance to the reduction of absolute poverty; and those who are not utilitarians surely must, if they
subscribe to the principle of universalisability, accept that at
least some of these things are of far less moral significance than
the absolute poverty that could be prevented by the money they
cost. So the third premise seems to be true on any plausible
ethical view - although the precise amount of absolute poverty
that can be prevented before anything of moral significance is
sacrificed will vary according to the ethical view one accepts.
Objections to the Argument
Taking care of our own. Anyone who has worked to increase
overseas aid will have come across the argument that we should
look after those near us, our families, and then the poor in our
own country, before we think about poverty in distant places.
No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are
close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many
can ignore a famine in Africa. But the question is not what we
usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see
any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or
community membership, makes a crucial difference to our
obligations.
Consider, for instance, racial affinities. Should people of European origin help poor Europeans before helping poor Africans? Most of us would reject such a suggestion out of hand,
and our discussion of the principle of equal consideration of
interests in Chapter 2 has shown why we should reject it: people's need for food has nothing to do with their race, and if
Africans need food more than Europeans, it would be a violation
232 

of the principle of equal consideration to give preference to
Europeans.
The same point applies to citizenship or nationhood. Every
affluent nation has some relatively poor citizens, but absolute
poverty is limited largely to the poor nations. Those living on
the streets of Calcutta, or in the drought-prone Sahel region of
Africa, are experiencing poverty unknown in the West. Under
these circumstances it would be wrong to decide that only those
fortunate enough to be citizens of our own community will
share our abundance.
We feel obligations of kinship more strongly than those of
citizenship. Which parents could give away their last bowl of
rice if their own children were starving? To do so would seem
unnatural, contrary to our nature as biologically evolved beings
- although whether it would be wrong is another question
altogether. In any case, we are not faced with that situation,
but with one in which our own children are well-fed, wellclothed, well-educated, and would now like new bikes, a stereo
set, or their own car. In these circumstances any special obligations we might have to our children have been fulfilled, and
the needs of strangers make a stronger claim upon us.
The element of truth in the view that we should first take
care of our own, lies in the advantage of a recognised system
of responsibilities. When families and local communities look
after their own poorer members, ties of affection and personal
relationships achieve ends that would otherwise require a large,
impersonal bureaucracy. Hence it would be absurd to propose
that from now on we all regard ourselves as equally responsible
for the welfare of everyone in the world; but the argument for
an obligation to assist does not propose that. It applies only
when some are in absolute poverty, and others can help without
sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance. To allow
one's own kin to sink into absolute poverty would be to sacrifice
something of comparable significance; and before that point had
been reached, the breakdown of the system of family and com233 

munity responsibility would be a factor to weigh the balance
in favour of a small degree of preference for family and community. This small degree of preference is, however, decisively
outweighed by existing discrepancies in wealth and property.
Property rights. Do people have a right to private property, a
right that contradicts the view that they are under an obligation
to give some of their wealth away to those in absolute poverty?
According to some theories of rights (for instance, Robert Nozick's), provided one has acquired one's property without the
use of unjust means like force and fraud, one may be entitled
to enormous wealth while others starve. This individualistic
conception of rights is in contrast to other views, like the early
Christian doctrine to be found in the works of Thomas Aquinas,
which holds that since property exists for the satisfaction of
human needs, 'whatever a man has in superabundance is owed,
of natural right, to the poor for their sustenance'. A socialist
would also, of course, see wealth as belonging to the community
rather than the individual, while utilitarians, whether socialist
or not, would be prepared to override property rights to prevent
great evils.
Does the argument for an obligation to assist others therefore
presuppose one of these other theories of property rights, and
not an individualistic theory like Nozick's? Not necessarily. A
theory of property rights can insist on our right to retain wealth
without pronouncing on whether the rich ought to give to the
poor. Nozick, for example, rejects the use of compulsory means
like taxation to redistribute income, but suggests that we can
achieve the ends we deem morally desirable by voluntary
means. So Nozick would reject the claim that rich people have
an 'obligation' to give to the poor, in so far as this implies that
the poor have a right to our aid, but might accept that giving
is something we ought to do and failing to give, though within
one's rights, is wrong - for there is more to an ethical life than
respecting the rights of others.
234 

The argument for an obligation to assist can survive, with
only minor modifications, even if we accept an individualistic
theory of property rights. In any ca£e, however, I do not think
we should accept such a theory. It leaves too much to chance
to be an acceptable ethical view. For instance, those whose
forefathers happened to inhabit some sandy wastes around the
Persian Gulf are now fabulously wealthy, because oil lay under
those sands; while those whose forefathers settled on better land
south of the Sahara live in absolute poverty, because of drought
and bad harvests. Can this distribution be acceptable from an
impartial point of view? If we imagine ourselves about to begin
life as a citizen of either Bahrein or Chad - but we do not know
which - would we accept the principle that citizens of Bahrein
are under no obligation to assist people living in Chad?
Population and the ethics of triage. Perhaps the most serious objection to the argument that we have an obligation to assist is
that since the major cause of absolute poverty is overpopulation,
helping those now in poverty will only ensure that yet more
people are born to live in poverty in the future.
In its most extreme form, this objection is taken to show that
we should adopt a policy of 'triage'. The term comes from medical policies adopted in wartime. With too few doctors to cope
with all the casualties, the wounded were divided into three
categories: those who would probably survive without medical
assistance, those who might survive if they received assistance,
but otherwise probably would not, and those who even with
medical assistance probably would not survive. Only those in
the middle category were given medical assistance. The idea, of
course, was to use limited medical resources as effectively as
possible. For those in the first category, medical treatment was
not strictly necessary; for those in the third category, it was
likely to be useless. It has been suggested that we should apply
the same policies to countries, according to their prospects of
becoming self-sustaining. We would not aid countries that even
235 

without our help will soon be able to feed their populations.
We would not aid countries that, even with our help, will not
be able to limit their population to a level they can feed. We
would aid those countries where our help might make the difference between success and failure in bringing food and population into balance.
Advocates of this theory are understandably reluctant to give
a complete list of the countries they would place into the 'hopeless' category; Bangladesh has been cited as an example, and
so have some of the countries of the Sahel region of Africa.
Adopting the policy of triage would, then, mean cutting off
assistance to these countries and allowing famine, disease, and
natural disasters to reduce the population of those countries to
the level at which they can provide adequately for all.
In support of this view Garrett Hardin has offered a metaphor:
we in the rich nations are like the occupants of a crowded
lifeboat adrift in a sea full of drowning people. If we try to save
the drowning by bringing them aboard, our boat will be overloaded and we shall all drown. Since it is better that some
survive than none, we should leave the others to drown. In the
world today, according to Hardin, 'lifeboat ethics' apply. The
rich should leave the poor to starve, for otherwise the poor will
drag the rich down with them.
Against this view, some writers have argued that overpopulation is a myth. The world produces ample food to feed its
population, and could, according to some estimates, feed ten
times as many. People are hungry not because there are too
many but because of inequitable land distribution, the manipulation of third world economies by the developed nations,
wastage of food in the West, and so on.
Putting aside the controversial issue of the extent to which
food production might one day be increased, it is true, as we
have already seen, that the world now produces enough to feed
its inhabitants - the amount lost by being fed to animals itself
being enough to meet existing grain shortages. Nevertheless
236 

population growth cannot be ignored. Bangladesh could, with
land reform and using better techniques, feed its present population of 115 million; but by the year 2000, according to United
Nations Population Division estiniates, its population will be
150 million. The enormous effort that will have to go into feeding an extra 35 million people, all added to the population
within a decade, means that Bangladesh must develop at full
speed to stay where it is. Other low-income countries are in
similar situations. By the end of the century, Ethiopia's population is expected to rise from 49 to 66 million; Somalia's from
7 to 9 million, India's from 853 to 1041 million, Zaire's from
35 to 49 million.2
What will happen if the world population continues to grow?
It cannot do so indefinitely. It will be checked by a decline in
birth rates or a rise in death rates. Those who advocate triage
are proposing that we allow the population growth of some
countries to be checked by a rise in death rates - that is, by
increased malnutrition, and related diseases; by widespread famines; by increased infant mortality; and by epidemics of infectious diseases.
The consequences of triage on this scale are so horrible that
we are inclined to reject it without further argument. How could
we sit by our television sets, watching millions starve while we
do nothing? Would not that be the end of all notions of human
equality and respect for human life? (Those who attack the
proposals for legalising euthanasia discussed in Chapter 7, saying that these proposals will weaken respect for human life,
would surely do better to object to the idea that we should
reduce or end our overseas aid programs, for that proposal, if
2 Ominously, in the twelve years that have passed between editions of this
book, the signs are that the situation is becoming even worse than was then
predicted. In 1979 Bangladesh had a population of 80 million and it was
predicted that by 2000 its population would reach 146 million; Ethiopia's
was only 29 million, and was predicted to reach 54 million; and India's was
620 million and predicted to reach 958 million.
237 

implemented, would be responsible for a far greater loss of
human life.) Don't people have a right to our assistance, irrespective of the consequences?
Anyone whose initial reaction to triage was not one of repugnance would be an unpleasant sort of person. Yet initial
reactions based on strong feelings are not always reliable guides.
Advocates of triage are rightly concerned with the long-term
consequences of our actions. They say that helping the poor
and starving now merely ensures more poor and starving in the
future. When our capacity to help is finally unable to cope - as
one day it must be - the suffering will be greater than it would
be if we stopped helping now. If this is correct, there is nothing
we can do to prevent absolute starvation and poverty, in the
long run, and so we have no obligation to assist. Nor does it
seem reasonable to hold that under these circumstances people
have a right to our assistance. If we do accept such a right,
irrespective of the consequences, we are saying that, in Hardin's
metaphor, we should continue to haul the drowning into our
lifeboat until the boat sinks and we all drown.
If triage is to be rejected it must be tackled on its own ground,
within the framework of consequentialist ethics. Here it is vulnerable. Any consequentialist ethics must take probability of
outcome into account. A course of action that will certainly
produce some benefit is to be preferred to an alternative course
that may lead to a slightly larger benefit, but is equally likely
to result in no benefit at all. Only if the greater magnitude of
the uncertain benefit outweighs its uncertainty should we
choose it. Better one certain unit of benefit than a 10 per cent
chance of five units; but better a 50 per cent chance of three
units than a single certain unit. The same principle applies when
we are trying to avoid evils.
The policy of triage involves a certain, very great evil: population control by famine and disease. Tens of millions would
die slowly. Hundreds of millions would continue to live in absolute poverty, at the very margin of existence. Against this
238 

prospect, advocates of the policy place a possible evil that is
greater still: the same process of famine and disease, taking place
in, say, fifty years' time, when tjie world's population may be
three times its present level, and the number who will die from
famine, or struggle on in absolute poverty, will be that much
greater. The question is: how probable is this forecast that continued assistance now will lead to greater disasters in the future?
Forecasts of population growth are notoriously fallible, and
theories about the factors that affect it remain speculative. One
theory, at least as plausible as any other, is that countries pass
through a 'demographic transition' as their standard of living
rises. When people are very poor and have no access to modern
medicine their fertility is high, but population is kept in check
by high death rates. The introduction of sanitation, modern
medical techniques, and other improvements reduces the death
rate, but initially has little effect on the birth rate. Then population grows rapidly. Some poor countries, especially in subSaharan Africa, are now in this phase. If standards of living
continue to rise, however, couples begin to realise that to have
the same number of children surviving to maturity as in the
past, they do not need to give birth to as many children as their
parents did. The need for children to provide economic support
in old age diminishes. Improved education and the emancipation and employment of women also reduce the birth-rate, and
so population growth begins to level off. Most rich nations have
reached this stage, and their populations are growing only very
slowly, if at all.
If this theory is right, there is an alternative to the disasters
accepted as inevitable by supporters of triage. We can assist poor
countries to raise the living standards of the poorest members
of their population. We can encourage the governments of these
countries to enact land reform measures, improve education,
and liberate women from a purely child-bearing role. We can
also help other countries to make contraception and sterilisation
widely available. There is a fair chance that these measures will
239 

hasten the onset of the demographic transition and bring population growth down to a manageable level. According to
United Nations estimates, in 1965 the average woman in the
third world gave birth to six children, and only 8 per cent were
using some form of contraception; by 1991 the average number
of children had dropped to just below four, and more than half
the women in the third world were taking contraceptive measures. Notable successes in encouraging the use of contraception
had occurred in Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil,
and Bangladesh. This achievement reflected a relatively low
expenditure in developing countries - considering the size and
significance of the problem - of $3 billion annually, with only
20 per cent of this sum coming from developed nations. So
expenditure in this area seems likely to be highly cost-effective.
Success cannot be guaranteed; but the evidence suggests that
we can reduce population growth by improving economic security and education, and making contraceptives more widely
available. This prospect makes triage ethically unacceptable. We
cannot allow millions to die from starvation and disease when
there is a reasonable probability that population can be brought
under control without such horrors.
Population growth is therefore not a reason against giving
overseas aid, although it should make us think about the kind
of aid to give. Instead of food handouts, it may be better to give
aid that leads to a slowing of population growth. This may mean
agricultural assistance for the rural poor, or assistance with education, or the provision of contraceptive services. Whatever
kind of aid proves most effective in specific circumstances, the
obligation to assist is not reduced.
One awkward question remains. What should we do about
a poor and already overpopulated country that, for religious or
nationalistic reasons, restricts the use of contraceptives and refuses to slow its population growth? Should we nevertheless
offer development assistance? Or should we make our offer
conditional on effective steps being taken to reduce the birth240 

rate? To the latter course, some would object that putting conditions on aid is an attempt to impose our own ideas on
independent sovereign nations. So it is - but is this imposition
unjustifiable? If the argument for an"»bligation to assist is sound,
we have an obligation to reduce absolute poverty; but we have
no obligation to make sacrifices that, to the best of our knowledge, have no prospect of reducing poverty in the long run.
Hence we have no obligation to assist countries whose governments have policies that will make our aid ineffective. This could
be very harsh on poor citizens of these countries - for they may
have no say in the government's policies - but we will help
more people in the long run by using our resources where they
are most effective. (The same principles may apply, incidentally,
to countries that refuse to take other steps that could make
assistance effective - like refusing to reform systems of land
holding that impose intolerable burdens on poor tenant
farmers.)
Leaving it to the government. We often hear that overseas aid
should be a government responsibility, not left to privately run
charities. Giving privately, it is said, allows the government to
escape its responsibilities.
Since increasing government aid is the surest way of making
a significant increase to the total amount of aid given, I would
agree that the governments of affluent nations should give much
more genuine, no-strings-attached, aid than they give now. Less
than one-sixth of one per cent of GNP is a scandalously small
amount for a nation as wealthy as the United States to give.
Even the official UN target of 0.7 per cent seems much less than
affluent nations can and should give - though it is a target few
have reached. But is this a reason against each of us giving what
we can privately, through voluntary agencies? To believe that
it is seems to assume that the more people there are who give
through voluntary agencies, the less likely it is that the government will do its part. Is this plausible? The opposite view - that
241 

if no one gives voluntarily the government will assume that its
citizens are not in favour of overseas aid, and will cut its programme accordingly - is more reasonable. In any case, unless
there is a definite probability that by refusing to give we would
be helping to bring about an increase in government assistance,
refusing to give privately is wrong for the same reason that triage
is wrong: it is a refusal to prevent a definite evil for the sake of
a very uncertain gain. The onus of showing how a refusal to
give privately will make the government give more is on those
who refuse to give.
This is not to say that giving privately is enough. Certainly
we should campaign for entirely new standards for both public
and private overseas aid. We should also work for fairer trading
arrangements between rich and poor countries, and less domination of the economies of poor countries by multinational
corporations more concerned about producing profits for shareholders back home than food for the local poor. Perhaps it is
more important to be politically active in the interests of the
poor than to give to them oneself - but why not do both?
Unfortunately, many use the view that overseas aid is the government's responsibility as a reason against giving, but not as
a reason for being politically active.
Too high a standard? The final objection to the argument for an
obligation to assist is that it sets a standard so high that none
but a saint could attain it. This objection comes in at least three
versions. The first maintains that, human nature being what it
is, we cannot achieve so high a standard, and since it is absurd
to say that we ought to do what we cannot do, we must reject
the claim that we ought to give so much. The second version
asserts that even if we could achieve so high a standard, to do
so would be undesirable. The third version of the objection is
that to set so high a standard is undesirable because it will be
perceived as too difficult to reach, and will discourage many
from even attempting to do so.
242 

Those who put forward the first version of the objection are
often influenced by the fact that we have evolved from a natural
process in which those with a high degree of concern for their
own interests, or the interests of their offspring and kin, can be
expected to leave more descendants in future generations, and
eventually to completely replace any who are entirely altruistic.
Thus the biologist Garrett Hardin has argued, in support of his
"lifeboat ethics', that altruism can only exist 'on a small scale,
over the short term, and within small, intimate groups'; while
Richard Dawkins has written, in his provocative book The Selfish
Gene: 'Much as we might wish to believe otherwise, universal
love and the welfare of the species as a whole are concepts
which simply do not make evolutionary sense.' I have already
noted, in discussing the objection that we should first take care
of our own, the very strong tendency for partiality in human
beings. We naturally have a stronger desire to further our own
interests, and those of our close kin, than we have to further
the interests of strangers. What this means is that we would be
foolish to expect widespread conformity to a standard that demands impartial concern, and for that reason it would scarcely
be appropriate or feasible to condemn all those who fail to reach
such a standard. Yet to act impartially, though it might be very
difficult, is not impossible. The commonly quoted assertion that
'ought' implies 'can' is a reason for rejecting such moral judgments as 'You ought to have saved all the people from the
sinking ship', when in fact if you had taken one more person
into the lifeboat, it would have sunk and you would not have
saved any. In that situation, it is absurd to say that you ought
to have done what you could not possibly do. When we have
money to spend on luxuries and others are starving, however,
it is clear that we can all give much more than we do give, and
we can therefore all come closer to the impartial standard proposed in this chapter. Nor is there, as we approach closer to this
standard, any barrier beyond which we cannot go. For that
reason there is no basis for saying that the impartial standard
243 

is mistaken because 'ought' implies 'can' and we cannot be
impartial.
The second version of the objection has been put by several
philosophers during the past decade, among them Susan Wolf
in a forceful article entitled 'Moral Saints'. Wolf argues that if
we all took the kind of moral stance defended in this chapter,
we would have to do without a great deal that makes life interesting: opera, gourmet cooking, elegant clothes, and professional sport, for a start. The kind of life we come to see as
ethically required of us would be a single-minded pursuit of the
overall good, lacking that broad diversity of interests and activities that, on a less demanding view, can be part of our ideal of
a good life for a human being. To this, however, one can respond
that while the rich and varied life that Wolf upholds as an ideal
may be the most desirable form of life for a human being in a
world of plenty, it is wrong to assume that it remains a good
life in a world in which buying luxuries for oneself means accepting the continued avoidable suffering of others. A doctor
faced with hundreds of injured victims of a train crash can
scarcely think it defensible to treat fifty of them and then go to
the opera, on the grounds that going to the opera is part of a
well-rounded human life. The life-or-death needs of others must
take priority. Perhaps we are like the doctor in that we live in
a time when we all have an opportunity to help to mitigate a
disaster.
Associated with this second version of the objection is the
claim that an impartial ethic of the kind advocated here makes
it impossible to have serious personal relationships based on
love and friendship; these relationships are, of their nature,
partial. We put the interests of our loved ones, our family, and
our friends ahead of those of strangers; if we did not do so,
would these relationships survive? I have already indicated, in
the response I gave when considering the objection that we
should first take care of our own, that there is a place, within
an impartially grounded moral framework, for recognising some
244 

degree of partiality for kin, and the same can be said for other
close personal relationships. Clearly, for most people, personal
relationships are among the necessities of a flourishing life, and
to give them up would be to sacrifice something of great moral
significance. Hence no such sacrifice is required by the principle
for which I am here arguing.
The third version of the objection asks: might it not be counterproductive to demand that people give up so much? Might
not people say: 'As I can't do what is morally required anyway,
I won't bother to give at all.' If, however, we were to set a more
realistic standard, people might make a genuine effort to reach
it. Thus setting a lower standard might actually result in more
aid being given.
It is important to get the status of this third version of the
objection clear. Its accuracy as a prediction of human behaviour
is quite compatible with the argument that we are obliged to
give to the point at which by giving more we sacrifice something
of comparable moral significance. What would follow from the
objection is that public advocacy of this standard of giving is
undesirable. It would mean that in order to do the maximum
to reduce absolute poverty, we should advocate a standard
lower than the amount we think people really ought to give.
Of course we ourselves - those of us who accept the original
argument, with its higher standard - would know that we ought
to do more than we publicly propose people ought to do, and
we might actually give more than we urge others to give. There
is no inconsistency here, since in both our private and our public
behaviour we are trying to do what will most reduce absolute
poverty.
For a consequentialist, this apparent conflict between public
and private morality is always a possibility, and not in itself an
indication that the underlying principle is wrong. The consequences of a principle are one thing, the consequences of publicly advocating it another. A variant of this idea is already
acknowledged by the distinction between the intuitive and crit245 

ical levels of morality, of which I have made use in previous
chapters. If we think of principles that are suitable for the intuitive level of morality as those that should be generally advocated, these are the principles that, when advocated, will give
rise to the best consequences. Where overseas aid is concerned,
those will be the principles that lead to largest amount being
given by the affluent to the poor.
Is it true that the standard set by our argument is so high as
to be counterproductive? There is not much evidence to go by,
but discussions of the argument, with students and others have
led me to think it might be. Yet, the conventionally accepted
standard - a few coins in a collection tin when one is waved
under your nose - is obviously far too low. What level should
we advocate? Any figure will be arbitrary, but there may be
something to be said for a round percentage of one's income
like, say, 10 per cent - more than a token donation, yet not so
high as to be beyond all but saints. (This figure has the additional
advantage of being reminiscent of the ancient tithe, or tenth,
that was traditionally given to the church, whose responsibilities
included care of the poor in one's local community. Perhaps
the idea can be revived and applied to the global community.)
Some families, of course, will find 10 per cent a considerable
strain on their finances. Others may be able to give more without
difficulty. No figure should be advocated as a rigid minimum
or maximum; but it seems safe to advocate that those earning
average or above average incomes in affluent societies, unless
they have an unusually large number of dependents or other
special needs, ought to give a tenth of their income to reducing
absolute poverty. By any reasonable ethical standards this is the
minimum we ought to do, and we do wrong if we do less.

INSIDERS AND OUTSIDERS
THE SHELTER
I
T is February 2002, and the world is taking stock of the
damage done by the nuclear war in the Middle East towards
the close of the previous year. The global level of radioactivity
now and for about eight years to come is so high that only those
living in fallout shelters can be confident of surviving in reasonable health. For the rest, who must breathe unfiltered air
and consume food and water with high levels of radiation, the
prospects are grim. Probably 10 per cent will die of radiation
sickness within the next two months; another 30 per cent are
expected to develop fatal forms of cancer within five years; and
even the remainder will have rates of cancer ten times higher
than normal, while the risk that their children will be malformed
is fifty times greater than before the war.
The fortunate ones, of course, are those who were far-sighted
enough to buy a share in the fallout shelters built by real-estate
speculators as international tensions rose in the late 1990s. Most
of these shelters were designed as underground villages, each
with enough accommodation and supplies to provide for the
needs of 10,000 people for twenty years. The villages are selfgoverning, with democratic constitutions that were agreed to
in advance. They also have sophisticated security systems that
enable them to admit to the shelter whoever they decide to
admit, and keep out all others.
The news that it will not be necessary to stay in the shelters
for much more than eight years has naturally been greeted with
247 

joy by the members of an underground community called Fairhaven. But it has also led to the first serious friction among
them. For above the shaft that leads down to Fairhaven, there
are thousands of people who are not investors in a shelter. These
people can be seen, and heard, through television cameras installed at the entrance. They are pleading to be admitted. They
know that if they can get into a shelter quickly, they will escape
most of the consequences of exposure to radiation. At first,
before it was known how long it would be until it was safe to
return to the outside, these pleas had virtually no support from
within the shelter. Now, however, the case for admitting at least
some of them has become much stronger. Since the supplies
need last only eight years, they will stretch to more than double
the number of people at present in the shelters. Accommodation
presents only slightly greater problems: Fairhaven was designed
to function as a luxury retreat when not needed for a real emergency, and it is equipped with tennis courts, swimming pools,
and a large gymnasium. If everyone were to consent to keep fit
by doing aerobics in their own living rooms, it would be possible
to provide primitive but adequate sleeping space for all those
whom the supplies can stretch to feed.
So those outside are now not lacking advocates on the inside.
The most extreme, labelled 'bleeding hearts' by their opponents,
propose that the shelter should admit an additional 10,000 people - as many as it can reasonably expect to feed and house
until it is safe to return to the outside. This will mean giving up
all luxury in food and facilities; but the bleeding hearts point
out that the fate for those who remain on the outside will be
far worse.
The bleeding hearts are opposed by some who urge that
these outsiders generally are an inferior kind of person, for they
were either not sufficiently far-sighted, or else not sufficiently
wealthy, to invest in a shelter; hence, it is said, they will cause
social problems in the shelter, placing an additional strain on
health, welfare, and educational services and contributing to an
248 

increase in crime and juvenile delinquency. The opposition to
admitting outsiders is also supported by a small group who say
that it would be an injustice to those who have paid for their
share of the shelter if others who have not paid benefit by it.
These opponents of admitting others are articulate, but few;
their numbers are bolstered considerably, however, by many
who say only that they really enjoy tennis and swimming and
don't want to give it up.
Between the bleeding hearts and those who oppose admitting
any outsiders, stands a middle group: those who think that, as
an exceptional act of benevolence and charity, some outsiders
should be admitted, but not so many as to make a significant
difference to the quality of life within the shelter. They propose
converting a quarter of the tennis courts to sleeping accommodation, and giving up a small public open space that has
attracted little use anyway. By these means, an extra 500 people
could be accommodated, which the self-styled 'moderates' think
would be a sensible figure, sufficient to show that Fairhaven is
not insensitive to the plight of those less fortunate than its own
members.
A referendum is held. There are three proposals: to admit
10,000 outsiders; to admit 500 outsiders; and to admit no outsiders. For which would you vote?
THE REAL WORLD
Like the issue of overseas aid, the situation of refugees today
raises an ethical question about the boundaries of our moral
community - not, as in earlier chapters, on grounds of species,
stage of development, or intellectual capacities, but on nationality. The great majority of the approximately 15 million refugees in the world today are receiving refuge, at least temporarily,
in the poorer and less developed countries of the world. More
than 12 million refugees are in the less developed countries of
Africa, Asia and Latin America. The effect on a poor country of
249 

receiving a sudden influx of millions of refugees can be gauged
from the experience of Pakistan during the 1980s, when it was
home to 2.8 million Afghan refugees - mainly living in the
North West Frontier province. Although Pakistan did get some
outside assistance to feed its refugees, the effects of bearing the
burden of this refugee population for seven years was easily
seen around refugee villages. Whole hillsides were denuded of
trees as a result of the collection of wood for fuel for the refugees.
According to Article 14 of the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.' The United
Nations High Commission for Refugees was established in 1950
and the commissioner entrusted with the protection of any
person who is outside the country of his nationality because of a
well founded fear of persecution by reason of his race, religion,
nationality or political opinion, and is unwilling or unable to
avail himself of the protection of his own government'. This definition was originally designed to meet the dislocation caused
by the Second World War in Europe. It is a narrow one, demanding that claims to refugee status be investigated case by case. It
has failed to cover the large-scale movements of people in times
of war, famine, or civil disturbance that have occurred since.
Less than generous responses to refugees are usually justified
by blaming the victim. It has become common to distinguish
'genuine refugees' from 'economic refugees' and to claim that
the latter should receive no assistance. This distinction is dubious, for most refugees leave their countries at great risk and
peril to their lives - crossing seas in leaky boats under attack
from pirates, or making long journeys over armed borders, to
arrive penniless in refugee camps. To distinguish between someone fleeing from political persecution and someone who flees
from a land made uninhabitable by prolonged drought is difficult to justify when they are in equal need of a refuge. The
UN definition, which would not classify the latter as a refugee,
defines away the problem.
250 

What are the possible durable solutions for refugees in the
world today? The main options are: voluntary repatriation, local
integration in the country they first flee to, and resettlement.
Probably the best and most humane solution for refugees
would be to return home. Unfortunately for the majority, voluntary repatriation is not possible because the conditions that
caused them to flee have not changed sufficiently. Local settlement, where refugees can remain and rebuild their lives in
neighbouring countries, is too often impossible because of the
inability of poor, economically struggling - and politically unstable - countries to absorb a new population when their indigenous people face a daily struggle for survival. This option
works best where ethnic and tribal links cross national frontiers.
The difficulty of achieving either voluntary repatriation or
local settlement leaves resettlement in a more remote country
as the only remaining option. With the number of refugees
needing resettlement reaching dimensions never before experienced, the main response of the industrialised countries has
been to institute deterrent policies and close their doors as tight
as they can. Admittedly, resettlement can never solve the problems that make refugees leave their homes. Nor is it, of itself,
a solution to the world refugee problem. Only about 2 per cent
of the world's refugees are permanently resettled. Nevertheless,
the resettlement option is a significant one. It provides markedly
better lives for a considerable number of individuals, even if not
for a large proportion of the total number of refugees.
Resettlement also affects the policies of those countries to
which refugees first flee. If such countries have no hope that
refugees will be resettled, they know that their burden will grow
with every refugee who enters their country. And countries of
first refuge are among those least able to support additional
people. When the resettlement option tightens, the countries to
which refugees first go adopt policies to try to discourage
potential refugees from leaving their country. This policy will
include turning people back at the border, making the camps
251 

as unattractive as possible, and screening the refugees as they
cross the border.
Resettlement is the only solution for those who cannot return
to their own countries in the foreseeable future and are only
welcome temporarily in the country to which they have fled;
in other words for those who have nowhere to go. There are
millions who would choose this option if there were countries
who would take them. For these refugees, resettlement may
mean the difference between life and death. It certainly is their
only hope for a decent existence.
THE EX GRATIA APPROACH
A widely held attitude is that we are under no moral or legal
obligation to accept any refugees at all; and if we do accept
some, it is an indication of our generous and humanitarian
character. Though popular, this view is not self-evidently morally sound. Indeed, it appears to conflict with other attitudes
that are, if we can judge from what people say, at least as widely
held, including the belief in the equality of all human beings,
and the rejection of principles that discriminate on the basis of
race or national origin.
All developed nations safeguard the welfare of their residents
in many ways - protecting their legal rights, educating their
children, and providing social security payments and access to
medical care, either universally or for those who fall below a
defined level of poverty. Refugees receive none of these benefits
unless they are accepted into the country. Since the overwhelming majority of them are not accepted, the overwhelming majority will not receive these benefits. But is this distinction in
the way in which we treat residents and nonresidents ethically
defensible?
Very few moral philosophers have given any attention to the
issue of refugees, even though it is clearly one of the major
moral issues of our time and raises significant moral questions
252 

about who is a member of our moral community. Take, for
example, John Rawls, the Harvard philosopher whose book, A
Theory of Justice, has been the most widely discussed aetount of
justice since its publication in 1971. This 500-page volume deals
exclusively with justice within a society, thus ignoring all the
hard questions about the principles that ought to govern how
wealthy societies respond to the claims of poorer nations, or of
outsiders in need.
One of the few philosophers who has addressed this issue is
another American, Michael Walzer. His Spheres of Justice opens
with a chapter entitled 'The Distribution of Membership' in
which he asks how we constitute the community within which
distribution takes place. In the course of this chapter Walzer
seeks to justify something close to the present situation with
regard to refugee policy. The first question Walzer addresses is:
do countries have the right to close their borders to potential
immigrants? His answer is that they do, because without such
closure, or at least the power to close borders if desired, distinct
communities cannot exist.
Given that the decision to close borders can rightfully be
made, Walzer then goes on to consider how it should be exercised. He compares the political community with a club, and
with a family. Clubs are examples of the ex gratia approach:
'Individuals may be able to give good reason why they should
be selected, but no one on the outside has a right to be inside.'
But Walzer considers the analogy imperfect, because states are
also a bit like families. They are morally bound to open the
doors of their country - not to anyone who wants to come in,
perhaps, but to a particular group of outsiders, recognised as
national or ethnic 'relatives.' In this way Walzer uses the analogy of a family to justify the principle of family reunion as a
basis for immigration policy.
As far as refugees are concerned, however, this is not much
help. Does a political community have the right to exclude
destitute, persecuted, and stateless men and women simply be253 

cause they are foreigners? In Walzer's view the community is
bound by a principle of mutual aid and he rightly notes that
this principle may have wider effects when applied to a community than when applied to an individual, because so many
benevolent actions are open to a community that will only
marginally affect its members. To take a stranger into one's
family is something that we might consider goes beyond the
requirement of mutual aid; but to take a stranger, or even many
strangers, into the community is far less burdensome.
In Walzer's view, a nation with vast unoccupied lands - he
takes Australia as his example, though by assumption rather
than by any examination of Australia's water and soil resources
- may indeed have an obligation in mutual aid to take in people
from densely populated, famine-stricken lands of Southeast
Asia. The choice for the Australian community would then be
to give up whatever homogeneity their society possessed, or to
retreat to a small portion of the land they occupied, yielding
the remainder to those who needed it.
Although not accepting any general obligation on affluent
nations to admit refugees, Walzer does uphold the popular principle of asylum. In accordance with this principle, any refugee
who manages to reach the shores of another country can claim
asylum and cannot be deported back to a country in which he
may be persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or
political opinion. It is interesting that this principle is so widely
supported, while the obligation to accept refugees is not. The
distinction drawn may reflect some of the principles discussed
in previous chapters of this book. The principle of proximity
clearly plays a role - the person seeking asylum is just physically
closer to us than those in other countries. Perhaps our stronger
support for asylum rests in part on the distinction between an
act (deporting a refugee who has arrived here) and an omission
(not offering a place to a refugee in a distant camp). It could
also be an instance of the difference between doing something
to an identifiable individual, and doing something that we know
254 

will have the same effect on someone, but we will never be
able to tell on whom it has this effect. A further factor is probably
the relatively small number of people who are actually able to
arrive in order to seek asylum, in contrast to the much larger
number of refugees of whose existence we are aware, although
they are far from us. This is the 'drops in the ocean' argument
that was discussed in connection with overseas aid. We can,
perhaps, cope with all the asylum seekers, but no matter how
many refugees we admit, the problem will still be there. As in
the case of the parallel argument against giving overseas aid,
this overlooks the fact that in admitting refugees, we enable
specific individuals to live decent lives and thus are doing something that is worthwhile, no matter how many other refugees
remain whom we are unable to help.
Moderately liberal governments, prepared to heed at least
some humanitarian sentiments, act much as Walzer suggests
they should. They hold that communities have a right to decide
whom they will admit; the claims of family reunion come first,
and those of outsiders from the national ethnic group - should
the state have an ethnic identity - next. The admission of those
in need is an ex gratia act. The right of asylum is usually respected, as long as the numbers are relatively small. Refugees,
unless they can appeal to some special sense of political affinity,
have no real claim to be accepted, and have to throw themselves
on the charity of the receiving country. All of this is in general
agreement with immigration policy in the Western democracies.
As far as refugees are concerned, the ex gratia approach is the
current orthodoxy.
THE FALLACY OF THE CURRENT APPROACH
The current orthodoxy rests on vague and usually unargued
assumptions about the community's right to determine its membership. A consequentialist would hold, instead, that immigration policy should be based squarely on the interests of all those
255 

affected. Where the interests of different parties conflict, we
should be giving equal consideration to all interests, which
would mean that more pressing or more fundamental interests
take precedence over less fundamental interests. The first step
in applying the principle of equal consideration of interests is
to identify those whose interests are affected. The first and most
obvious group is the refugees themselves. Their most pressing
and fundamental interests are clearly at stake. Life in a refugee
camp offers little prospect of anything more than a bare subsistence, and sometimes hardly even that. Here is one observer's
impression of a camp on the Thai-Cambodian border in 1986.
At the time the camp was home for 144,000 people:
The visit of a foreigner causes a ripple of excitement. People
gather round and ask earnestly about the progress of their case
for resettlement, or share their great despair at continual rejection
by the selection bodies for the various countries which will accept
refugees People wept as they spoke, most had an air of quiet
desperation On rice distribution day, thousands of girls and
women mill in the distribution area, receiving the weekly rations
for their family. From the bamboo observation tower the ground
below was just a swirling sea of black hair and bags of rice hoisted
onto heads for the walk home. A proud, largely farming people,
forced to become dependent on UN rations of water, tinned fish
and broken rice, just to survive.
Most of these people could hope for no significant change in
their lives for many years to come. Yet I, along with the others
from outside, could get into a car and drive out of the camp,
return to Taphraya or Aran, drink iced water, eat rice or noodles
at the roadside restaurant at the corner, and observe life passing
by. Those simplest parts of life were invested with a freedom I'd
never valued so highly.
At the same time, refugees accepted into another country have
a good chance of establishing themselves and leading a life as
satisfactory and fulfilling as most of us. Sometimes the interests
of the refugees in being accepted are as basic as the interest in
life itself. In other cases the situation may not be one of life or
256 

death, but it will still profoundly affect the whole course of a
person's life.
The next most directly affected group is the residents of the
recipient nation. How much they will be affected will vary according to how many refugees are taken, how well they will fit
into the community, the current state of the national economy,
and so on. Some residents will be more affected than others:
some will find themselves competing with the refugees for jobs,
and others will not; some will find themselves in a neighborhood with a high population of refugees, and others will not;
and this list could be continued indefinitely, too.
We should not assume that residents of the recipient nation
will be affected for the worse: the economy may receive a boost
from a substantial intake of refugees, and many residents may
find business opportunities in providing for their needs. Others
may enjoy the more cosmopolitan atmosphere created by new
arrivals from other countries: the exotic food shops and restaurants that spring up, and in the long run, the benefits of different
ideas and ways of living. One could argue that in many ways
refugees make the best immigrants. They have nowhere else to
go and must commit themselves totally to their new country,
unlike immigrants who can go home when or if they please.
The fact that they have survived and escaped from hardship
suggests stamina, initiative, and resources that would be of great
benefit to any receiving country. Certainly some refugee groups,
for instance the Indo-Chinese, have displayed great entrepreneurial vigour when resettled in countries like Australia or the
United States.
There are also some other possible and more diffuse consequences that we at least need to think about. For example, it
has been argued that to take large numbers of refugees from
poor countries into affluent ones will simply encourage the flow
of refugees in the future. If poor and over-populated countries
can get rid of their surplus people to other countries, they will
have a reduced incentive to do something about the root causes
257 

of the poverty of their people, and to slow population growth.
The end result could be just as much suffering as if we had
never taken the refugees in the first place.
Consequences also arise from not taking significant numbers
of refugees. Economic stability and world peace depend on international co-operation based on some measure of respect and
trust; but the resource-rich and not over-populated countries
of the world cannot expect to win the respect or trust of the
poorest and most crowded countries if they leave them to cope
with most of the refugee problem as best they can.
So we have a complex mix of interests - some definite, some
highly speculative - to be considered. Equal interests are to be
given equal weight, but which way does the balance lie? Consider a reasonably affluent nation that is not desperately overcrowded, like Australia (I take Australia merely as an example
of a country with which I am familiar; one could, with minor
modifications, substitute other affluent nations.) In the early
1990s Australia is admitting about 12,000 refugees a year, at a
time when there are several million refugees in refugee camps
around the world, many of whom have no hope of returning
to their previous country and are seeking resettlement in a country like Australia. Now let us imagine that Australia decides to
accept twice as many refugees each year as it has in fact been
doing. What can we say are the definite consequences of such
a decision, and what are the possible consequences?
The first definite consequence would be that each year 12,000
more refugees would have been out of the refugee camps and
settled in Australia, where they could expect, after a few years
of struggle, to share in the material comforts, civil rights, and
political security of that country. So 12,000 people would have
been very much better off.
The second definite consequence would have been that each
year Australia would have had 12,000 more immigrants, and
that these additional immigrants would not have been selected
258 

on the basis of possessing skills needed in the Australian economy. They would therefore place an additional demand on welfare services. Some long-term residents of Australia may be
disconcerted by the changes that take place in their neighborhood, as significant numbers of people from a very different
culture move in. More refugees would make some impact on
initial post-arrival services such as the provision of English language classes, housing in the first few months, job placement,
and retraining. But the differences would be minor - after all,
a decade earlier, Australia had accepted approximately 22,000
refugees a year. There were no marked adverse effects from this
larger intake.
At this point, if we are considering the definite consequences
of a doubled refugee intake, in terms of having a significant
impact on the interests of others, we come to a halt. We may
wonder if the increased numbers will lead to a revival of racist
feeling in the community. We could debate the impact on the
Australian environment. We might guess that a larger intake of
refugees will encourage others, in the country from which the
refugees came, to become refugees themselves in order to better
their economic condition. Or we could refer hopefully to the
contribution towards international goodwill that may flow from
a country like Australia easing the burden of less well-off nations
in supporting refugees. But all of these consequences are highly
speculative.
Consider the environmental impact of an extra 12,000 refugees. Certainly, more people will put some additional pressure
on the environment. This means that the increased number of
refugees accepted will be just one item in a long list of factors
that includes the natural rate of reproduction; the government's
desire to increase exports by encouraging an industry based on
converting virgin forests to wood-chips; the subdivision of rural
land in scenic areas for holiday houses; the spurt in popularity
of vehicles suitable for off-road use; the development of ski
259 

resorts in sensitive alpine areas; the use of no-deposit bottles
and other containers that increase litter - the list could be prolonged indefinitely.
If as a community we allow these other factors to have their
impact on the environment, while appealing to the need to
protect our environment as a reason for restricting our intake
of refugees to its present level, we are implicitly giving less
weight to the interests of refugees in coming to Australia than
we give to the interests of Australian residents in having holiday houses, roaring around the countryside in four-wheeldrive vehicles, going skiing, and throwing away their drink
containers without bothering to return them for recycling. Such
a weighting is surely morally outrageous, so flagrant a violation of the principle of equal consideration of interests that I
trust it has only to be exposed in order to be seen as indefensible.
The other arguments are even more problematical. No one
can really say whether doubling Australia's intake of refugees
would have any effect at all on the numbers who might consider
fleeing their own homes; nor is it possible to predict the consequences in terms of international relations. As with the similar
argument linking overseas aid with increased population, in a
situation in which the definite consequences of the proposed
additional intake of refugees are positive, it would be wrong to
decide against the larger intake on such speculative grounds,
especially since the speculative factors point in different directions.
So there is a strong case for Australia to double its refugee
intake. But there was nothing in the argument that relied on
the specific level of refugees now being taken by Australia. If
this argument goes through, it would also seem to follow that
Australia should be taking not an extra 12,000 refugees, but an
extra 24,000 refugees a year. Now the argument seems to be
going too far, for it can then be reapplied to this new level:
should Australia be taking 48,000 refugees? We can double and
260 

redouble the intakes of all the major nations of the developed
world, and the refugee camps around the world will still not
be empty. Indeed, the number of refugees who would seek
resettlement in the developed countries is not fixed, and probably there is some truth in the claim that if all those now in
refugee camps were to be accepted, more refugees would arrive
to take their places. Since the interests of the refugees in resettlement in a more prosperous country will always be greater
than the conflicting interests of the residents of those countries,
it would seem that the principle of equal consideration of interests points to a world in which all countries continue to accept
refugees until they are reduced to the same standard of poverty
and overcrowding as the third world countries from which the
refugees are seeking to flee.
Is this a reason for rejecting the original argument? Does it
mean that if we follow the original argument through it leads
to consequences that we cannot possibly accept; and therefore
there must be a flaw in the argument that has led us to such
an absurd conclusion? This does not follow. The argument
we put forward for doubling Australia's refugee intake does
not really imply that the doubled intake should then be redoubled, and redoubled again, ad infinitum. At some point in
this process - perhaps when the refugee intake is four times
what it now is, or perhaps when it is sixty-four times its
present level - the adverse consequences that are now only
speculative possibilities would become probabilities or virtual
certainties.
There would come a point at which, for instance, the resident
community had eliminated all luxuries that imperilled the environment, and yet the basic needs of the expanding population
were putting such pressure on fragile ecological systems that a
further expansion would do irreparable harm. Or there might
come a point at which tolerance in a multicultural society was
breaking down because of resentment among the resident community, whose members believed that their children were un261 

able to get jobs because of competition from the hard-working
new arrivals; and this loss of tolerance might reach the point
at which it was a serious danger to the peace and security of
all previously accepted refugees and other immigrants from different cultures. When any such point had been reached, the
balance of interests would have swung against a further increase
in the intake of refugees.
The present refugee intake might increase quite dramatically
before any consequences like those mentioned above were
reached; and some may take this as a consequence sufficiently
unacceptable to support the rejection of our line of argument.
Certainly anyone starting from the assumption that the status
quo must be roughly right will be likely to take that view.
But the status quo is the outcome of a system of national
selfishness and political expediency, and not the result of a
considered attempt to work out the moral obligations of the
developed nations in a world with 15 million refugees.
It would not be difficult for the nations of the developed world
to move closer towards fulfilling their moral obligations to refugees. There is no objective evidence to show that doubling
their refugee intake would cause them any harm whatsoever.
Much present evidence, as well as past experience, points the
other way, suggesting that they and their present population
would probably benefit.
But, the leaders will cry, what is moral is not what is
politically acceptable! This is a spurious excuse for inaction.
In many policy areas, presidents and prime ministers are quite
happy to try to convince the electorate of what is right - of
the need to tighten belts in order to balance budgets, or to
desist from drinking and driving. They could just as easily
gradually increase their refugee intakes, monitoring the effects
of the increase through careful research. In this way they
would fulfill their moral and geopolitical obligations and still
benefit their own communities.

SHELTERS AND REFUGES
How would you have voted, in the referendum conducted in
Fairhaven in 1998? I think most people would have been prepared to sacrifice not just a quarter, but all of the tennis courts
to the greater need of those outside. But if you would have
voted with the 'bleeding hearts' in that situation, it is difficult
to see how you can disagree with the conclusion that affluent
nations should be taking far, far more refugees than they are
taking today. For the situation of refugees is scarcely better than
that of the outsiders in peril from nuclear radiation; and the
luxuries that we would have to sacrifice are surely no greater.

THE ENVIRONMENT
A river tumbles through forested ravines and rocky gorges towards the sea. The state hydro-electricity commission sees the
falling water as untapped energy. Building a dam across one of
the gorges would provide three years of employment for a thousand people, and longer-term employment for twenty or thirty.
The dam would store enough water to ensure that the state could
economically meet its energy needs for the next decade. This
would encourage the establishment of energy-intensive industry
thus further contributing to employment and economic growth.
The rough terrain of the river valley makes it accessible only to
the reasonably fit, but it is nevertheless a favoured spot for bushwalking. The river itself attracts the more daring whitewater
rafters. Deep in the sheltered valleys are stands of rare Huon
Pine, many of the trees being over a thousand years old. The
valleys and gorges are home to many birds and animals, including an endangered species of marsupial mouse that has seldom
been found outside the valley. There may be other rare plants
and animals as well, but no one knows, for scientists are yet to
investigate the region fully.
S
H O U L D the dam be built? This is one example of a situation
in which we must choose between very different sets of
values. The description is loosely based on a proposed dam on
the Franklin River, in the southwest of Australia's island state,
Tasmania - an account of the outcome can be found in Chapter
11, but I have deliberately altered some details, and the above
description should be treated as a hypothetical case. Many other
examples would have posed the choice between values equally
well: logging virgin forests, building a paper mill that will release
pollutants into coastal waters, or opening a new mine on the
264 

edge of a national park. A different set of examples would raise
related, but slightly different, issues: the use of products that
contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer, or to the greenhouse effect; building more nuclear power stations; and so on.
In this chapter I explore the values that underlie debates about
these decisions, and the example I have presented can serve as
a point of reference to these debates. I shall focus particularly
on the values at issue in controversies about the preservation
of wilderness because here the fundamentally different values
of the two parties are most apparent. When we are talking about
flooding a river valley, the choice before us is starkly clear.
In general we can say that those who favour building the
dam are valuing employment and a higher per capita income
for the state above the preservation of wilderness, of plants and
animals (both common ones and members of an endangered
species), and of opportunities for outdoor recreational activities.
Before we begin to scrutinise the values of those who would
have the dam build and those who would not, however, let us
briefly investigate the origins of modern attitudes towards the
natural world.
THE WESTERN TRADITION
Western attitudes to nature grew out of a blend of those of the
Hebrew people, as represented in the early books of the Bible,
and the philosophy of the ancient Greeks, particularly that of
Aristotle. In contrast to some other ancient traditions, for example, those of India, both the Hebrew and the Greek traditions
made human beings the centre of the moral universe - indeed
not merely the centre, but very often, the entirety of the morally
significant features of this world.
The biblical story of creation, in Genesis, makes clear the
Hebrew view of the special place of human beings in the divine
plan:
265 

And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them, and God said upon them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have
dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air,
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Today Christians debate the meaning of this grant of 'dominion'; and those concerned about the environment claim that
it should be regarded hot as a license to do as we will with other
living things, but rather as a directive to look after them, on
God's behalf, and be answerable to God for the way in which
we treat them. There is, however, little justification in the text
itself for such an interpretation; and given the example God set
when he drowned almost every animal on earth in order to
punish human beings for their wickedness, it is no wonder that
people should think the flooding of a single river valley is nothing worth worrying about. After the flood there is a repetition
of the grant of dominion in more ominous language: 'And the
fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of
the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your
hands are they delivered.'
The implication is clear: to act in a way that causes fear and
dread to everything that moves on the earth is not improper;
it is, in fact, in accordance with a God-given decree.
The most influential early Christian thinkers had no doubts
about how man's dominion was to be understood. 'Doth God
care for oxen?' asked Paul, in the course of a discussion of an
Old Testament command to rest one's ox on the sabbath, but
it was only a rhetorical question - he took it for granted that
the answer must be negative, and the command was to be
explained in terms of some benefit to humans. Augustine shared
266 

this line of thought; referring to stories in the New Testament
in which Jesus destroyed a fig tree and caused a herd of pigs
to drown, Augustine explained these puzzling incidents as intended to teach us that 'to refrain from the killing of animals
and the destroying of plants is the height of superstition'.
When Christianity prevailed in the Roman Empire, it also
absorbed elements of the ancient Greek attitude to the natural
world. The Greek influence was entrenched in Christian philosophy by the greatest of the medieval scholastics, Thomas
Aquinas, whose life work was the melding of Christian theology
with the thought of Aristotle. Aristotle regarded nature as a
hierarchy in which those with less reasoning ability exist for
the sake of those with more:
Plants exist for the sake of animals, and brute beasts for the sake
of man — domestic animals for his use and food, wild ones (or
at any rate most of them) for food and other accessories of life,
such as clothing and various tools.
Since nature makes nothing purposeless or in vain, it is undeniably true that she has made all animals for the sake of man.
In his own major work, the Summa Theologica, Aquinas followed this passage from Aristotle almost word for word, adding
that the position accords with God's command, as given in
Genesis. In his classification of sins, Aquinas has room only for
sins against God, ourselves, or our neighbours. There is no possibility of sinning against non-human animals, or against the
natural world.
This was the thinking of mainstream Christianity for at least
its first eighteen centuries. There were gentler spirits, certainly,
like Basil, John Chrysostom, and Francis of Assisi, but for most
of Christian history they have had no significant impact on the
dominant tradition. It is therefore worth emphasising the major
features of this dominant Western tradition, because these features can serve as a point of comparison when we discuss different views of the natural environment.
According to the dominant Western tradition, the natural
267 

world exists for the benefit of human beings. God gave human
beings dominion over the natural world, and God does not care
how we treat it. Human beings are the only morally important
members of this world. Nature itself is of no intrinsic value, and
the destruction of plants and animals cannot be sinful, unless
by this destruction we harm human beings.
Harsh as this tradition is, it does not rule out concern for the
preservation of nature, as long as that concern can be related
to human well-being. Often, of course, it can be. One could,
entirely within the limits of the dominant Western tradition,
oppose nuclear power on the grounds that nuclear fuel, whether
in bombs or power stations, is so hazardous to human life that
the uranium is better left in the ground. Similarly, many arguments against pollution, the use of gases harmful to the ozone
layer, the burning of fossil fuels, and the destruction of forests,
could be couched in terms of the harm to human health and
welfare from the pollutants, or the changes to the climate that
will occur as a result of the use of fossil fuels and the loss of
forest. The greenhouse effect - to take just one danger to our
environment - threatens to bring about a rise in sea level that
will inundate low-lying coastal areas. This includes the fertile
and densely populated Nile delta in Egypt, and the Bengal delta
region, which covers 80 per cent of Bangladesh and is already
subject to violent seasonal storms that cause disastrous floods.
The homes and livelihood of 46 million people are at risk in
these two deltas alone. A rise in sea level could also wipe out
entire island nations such as the Maldives, none of which is
more than a metre or two above sea level. So it is obvious that
even within a human-centred moral framework, the preservation of our environment is a value of the greatest possible
importance.
From the standpoint of a form of civilisation based on growing
crops and grazing animals, wilderness may seem to be a wasteland, a useless area that needs clearing in order to render it
productive and valuable. There was a time when villages sur268 

rounded by farmland seemed like oases of cultivation amongst
the deserts of forest or rough mountain slopes. Now, however,
a different metaphor is more appropriate: the remnants of true
wilderness left to us are like islands amidst a sea of human
activity that threatens to engulf them. This gives wilderness a
scarcity value that provides the basis for a strong argument for
preservation, even within the terms of a human-centred ethic.
That argument becomes much stronger still when we take a
long-term view. To this immensely important aspect of environmental values we shall now turn.
FUTURE GENERATIONS
A virgin forest is the product of all the millions of years that
have passed since the beginning of our planet. If it is cut down,
another forest may grow up, but the continuity has been broken.
The disruption in the natural life cycles of the plants and animals
means that the forest will never again be as it would have been,
had it not been cut. The gains made from cutting the forest -
employment, profits for business, export earnings, and cheaper
cardboard and paper for packaging - are short-term benefits.
Even if the forest is not cut, but drowned to build a dam to
create electricity, it is likely that the benefits will last for only a
generation or two: after that new technology will render such
methods of generating power obsolete. Once the forest is cut or
drowned, however, the link with the past has gone for ever.
That is a cost that will be borne by every generation that succeeds
us on this planet. It is for that reason that environmentalists are
right to speak of wilderness as a 'world heritage'. It is something
that we have inherited from our ancestors, and that we must
preserve for our descendants, if they are to have it at all.
In contrast to many more stable, tradition-oriented human
societies, our modern political and cultural ethos has great difficulty in recognising long-term values. Politicians are notorious
for not looking beyond the next election; but even if they do,
269 

they will find their economic advisers telling them that anything
to be gained in the future should be discounted to such a degree
as to make it easy to disregard the long-term future altogether.
Economists have been taught to apply a discount rate to all
future goods. In other words, a million dollars in twenty years
is not worth a million dollars today, even when we allow for
inflation. Economists will discount the value of the million dollars by a certain percentage, usually corresponding to the real
long-term interest rates. This makes economic sense, because if
I had a thousand dollars today I could invest it so that it would
be worth more, in real terms, in twenty years. But the use of a
discount rate means that values gained one hundred years hence
rank very low, in comparison with values gained today; and
values gained one thousand years in the future scarcely count
at all. This is not because of any uncertainty about whether
there will be human beings or other sentient creatures inhabiting
this planet at that time, but merely because of the cumulative
effect of the rate of return on money invested now. From the
standpoint of the priceless and timeless values of wilderness,
however, applying a discount rate gives us the wrong answer.
There are some things that, once lost, no amount of money can
regain. Thus to justify the destruction of an ancient forest on
the grounds that it will earn us substantial export income is
unsound, even if we could invest that income and increase its
value from year to year; for no matter how much we increased
its value, it could never buy back the link with the past represented by the forest.
This argument does not show that there can be no justification
for cutting any virgin forests, but it does mean that any such
justification must take full account of the value of the forests to
the generations to come in the more remote future, as well as
in the more immediate future. This value will obviously be
related to the particular scenic or biological significance of the
forest; but as the proportion of true wilderness on the earth
dwindles, every part of it becomes significant,! because the op270 

portunities for experiencing wilderness become scarce, and the
likelihood of a reasonable selection of the major forms of wilderness being preserved is reduced.
Can we be sure that future generations will appreciate wilderness? Perhaps they will be happier sitting in air-conditioned
shopping malls, playing computer games more sophisticated
than any we can imagine? That is possible. But there are
several reasons why we should not give this possibility too
much weight. First, the trend has been in the opposite direction: the appreciation of wilderness has never been higher
than it is today, especially among those nations that have
overcome the problems of poverty and hunger and have relatively little wilderness left. Wilderness is valued as something
of immense beauty, as a reservoir of scientific knowledge still
to be gained, for the recreational opportunities that it provides,
and because many people just like to know that something
natural is still there, relatively untouched by modern civilisation. If, as we all hope, future generations are able to provide
for the basic needs of most people, we can expect that for
centuries to come, they, too, will value wilderness for the
same reasons that we value it.
Arguments for preservation based on the beauty of wilderness
are sometimes treated as if they were of little weight because
they are 'merely aesthetic'. That is a mistake. We go to great
lengths to preserve the artistic treasures of earlier human civilisations. It is difficult to imagine any economic gain that we
would be prepared to accept as adequate compensation for, for
instance, the destruction of the paintings in the Louvre. How
should we compare the aesthetic value of wilderness with that
of the paintings in the Louvre? Here, perhaps, judgment does
become inescapably subjective; so I shall report my own experiences. I have looked at the paintings in the Louvre, and in
many of the other great galleries of Europe and the United
States. I think I have a reasonable sense of appreciation of the
271 
1

fine arts; yet I have not had, in any museum, experiences that
have filled my aesthetic senses in the way that they are filled
when I walk in a natural setting and pause to survey the view
from a rocky peak overlooking a forested valley, or sit by a
stream tumbling over moss-covered boulders set amongst tall
tree-ferns, growing in the shade of the forest canopy. I do not
think I am alone in this; for many people, wilderness is the
source of the greatest feelings of aesthetic appreciation, rising
to an almost spiritual intensity.
It may nevertheless be true that this appreciation of nature
will not be shared by people living a century or two hence. But
if wilderness can be the source of such deep joy and satisfaction,
that would be a great loss. To some extent, whether future
generations value wilderness is up to us; it is, at least, a decision
we can influence. By our preservation of areas of wilderness,
we provide an opportunity for generations to come, and by the
books and films we produce, we create a culture that can be
handed on to our children and their children. If we feel that a
walk in the forest, with senses attuned to the appreciation of
such an experience, is a more deeply rewarding way to spend
a day than playing computer games, or if we feel that to carry
one's food and shelter in a backpack for a week while hiking
through an unspoiled natural environment will do more to develop character than watching television for an equivalent period, then we ought to encourage future generations to have a
feeling for nature; if they end up preferring computer games,
we shall have failed.
Finally, if we preserve intact the amount of wilderness that
exists now, future generations will at least have the choice of
getting up from their computer games and going to see a world
that has not been created by human beings. If we destroy the
wilderness, that choice is gone forever. Just as we rightly spend
large sums to preserve cities like Venice, even though future
generations conceivably may not be interested in such architectural treasures, so we should preserve wilderness even
272 

though it is possible that future generations will care little for
it. Thus we will not wrong future generations, as we have been
wronged by members of past generations whose thoughtless
actions have deprived us of the possibility of seeing such animals
as the dodo, Steller's sea cow, or the thylacine, the Tasmanian
marsupial 'tiger'. We must take care not to inflict equally irreparable losses on the generations to follow us.
Here, too, the effort to mitigate the greenhouse effect deserves
the highest priority. For if by 'wilderness' we mean that part of
our planet that is unaffected by human activity, perhaps it is
already too late: there may be no wilderness left anywhere on
our planet. Bill McKibben has argued that by depleting the
ozone layer and increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, we have already brought about the change encapsulated in the title of his book - The End of Nature: 'By changing
the weather, we make every spot on earth man-made and artificial. We have deprived nature of its independence, and that
is fatal to its meaning. Nature's independence is its meaning;
without it there is nothing but us.'
This is a profoundly disturbing thought. Yet McKibben does
not develop it in order to suggest that we may as well give up
our efforts to reverse the trend. It is true that in one sense of
the term, 'nature' is finished. We have passed a watershed in
the history of our planet. As McKibben says, 'we live in a postnatural world'. Nothing can undo that; the climate of our planet
is under our influence. We still have, however, much that we
value in nature, and it may still be possible to save what is left.
Thus a human-centred ethic can be the basis of powerful
arguments for what we may call 'environmental values'. Such
an ethic does not imply that economic growth is more important
than the preservation of wilderness; on the contrary, it is quite
compatible with a human-centred ethic to see economic growth
based on the exploitation of irreplaceable resources as something that brings gains to the present generation, and possibly
the next generation or two, but at a price that will be paid by
273 

every generation to come. But in the light of our discussion of
speciesism in Chapter 3, it should also be clear that it is wrong
to limit ourselves to a human-centred ethic. We now need to
consider more fundamental challenges to this traditional Western approach to environmental issues.
IS THERE VALUE BEYOND SENTIENT BEINGS?
Although some debates about significant environmental issues
can be conducted by appealing only to the long-term interests
of our own species, in any serious exploration of environmental
values a central issue will be the question of intrinsic value. We
have already seen that it is arbitrary to hold that only human
beings are of intrinsic value. If we find value in human conscious
experiences, we cannot deny that there is value in at least some
experiences of non-human beings. How far does intrinsic value
extend? To all, but only, sentient beings? Or beyond the boundary of sentience?
To explore this question a few remarks on the notion of 'intrinsic value' will be helpful. Something is of intrinsic value if
it is good or desirable in itself; the contrast is with 'instrumental
value', that is, value as a means to some other end or purpose.
Our own happiness, for example, is of intrinsic value, at least
to most of us, in that we desire it for its own sake. Money, on
the other hand, is only of instrumental value to us. We want it
because of the things we can buy with it, but if we were marooned on a desert island, we would not want it. (Whereas
happiness would be just as important to us on a desert island
as anywhere else.)
Now consider again for a moment the issue of damming the
river described at the beginning of this chapter. If the decision
were to be made on the basis of human interests alone, we
would balance the economic benefits of the dam for the citizens
of the state against the loss for bushwalkers, scientists, and
others, now and in the future, who value the preservation of
274 

the river in its natural state. We have already seen that because
this calculation includes an indefinite number of future generations, the loss of the wild river is a much greater cost than
we might at first imagine. Even so, once we broaden the basis
of our decision beyond the interests of human beings, we have
much more to set against the economic benefits of building the
dam. Into the calculations must now go the interests of all the
non-human animals who live in the area that will be flooded.
A few may be able to move to a neighboring area that is suitable,
but wilderness is not full of vacant niches awaiting an occupant;
if there is territory that can sustain a native animal, it is most
likely already occupied. Thus most of the animals living in the
flooded area will die: either they will be drowned, or they will
starve. Neither drowning nor starvation are easy ways to die,
and the suffering involved in these deaths should, as we have
seen, be given no less weight than we would give to an equivalent amount of suffering experienced by human beings. This
will significantly increase the weight of considerations against
building the dam.
What of the fact that the animals will die, apart from the
suffering that will occur in the course of dying? As we have
seen, one can, without being guilty of arbitrary discrimination
on the basis of species, regard the death of a non-human animal
who is not a person as less significant than the death of a person,
since humans are capable of foresight and forward planning in
ways that non-human animals are not. This difference between
causing death to a person and to a being who is not a person
does not mean that the death of an animal who is not a person
should be treated as being of no account. On the contrary,
utilitarians will take into account the loss that death inflicts on
the animals - the loss of all their future existence, and the
experiences that their future lives would have contained. When
a proposed dam would flood a valley and kill thousands, perhaps millions, of sentient creatures, these deaths should be given
great importance in any assessment of the costs and benefits of
275 

building the dam. For those utilitarians who accept the total
view discussed in Chapter 4, moreover, if the dam destroys the
habitat in which the animals lived, then it is relevant that this
loss is a continuing one. If the dam is not built, animals will
presumably continue to live in the valley for thousands of years,
experiencing their own distinctive pleasures and pains. One
might question whether life for animals in a natural environment yields a surplus of pleasure over pain, or of satisfaction
over frustration of preferences. At this point the idea of calculating benefits becomes almost absurd; but that does not mean
that the loss of future animal lives should be dismissed from
our decision making.
That, however, may not be all. Should we also give weight,
not only to the suffering and death of individual animals, but
to the fact that an entire species may disappear? What of the
loss of trees that have stood for thousands of years? How much
- if any - weight should we give to the preservation of the
animals, the species, the trees and the valley's ecosystem, independendy of the interests of human beings - whether economic, recreational, or scientific - in their preservation?
Here we have a fundamental moral disagreement: a disagreement about what kinds of beings ought to be considered in
our moral deliberations. Let us look at what has been said on
behalf of extending ethics beyond sentient beings.
REVERENCE FOR LIFE
The ethical position developed in this book is an extension of
the ethic of the dominant Western tradition. This extended
ethic draws the boundary of moral consideration around all
sentient creatures, but leaves other living things outside that
boundary. The drowning of the ancient forests, the possible
loss of an entire species, the destruction of several complex
ecosystems, the blockage of the wild river itself, and the loss
of those rocky gorges are factors to be taken into account only
276 

in so far as they adversely affect sentient creatures. Is a more
radical break with the traditional position possible? Can some
or all of these aspects of the flooding of the valley be shown
to have intrinsic value, so that they must be taken into account
independently of their effects on human beings or non-human
animals?
To extend an ethic in a plausible way beyond sentient beings
is a difficult task. An ethic based on the interests of sentient
creatures is on familiar ground. Sentient creatures have wants
and desires. The question: 'What is it like to be a possum
drowning?' at least makes sense, even if it is impossible for
us to give a more precise answer than 'It must be horrible'.
In reaching moral decisions affecting sentient creatures, we
can attempt to add up the effects of different actions on all
the sentient creatures affected by the alternative actions open
to us. This provides us with at least some rough guide to what
might be the right thing to do. But there is nothing that corresponds to what it is like to be a tree dying because its roots
have been flooded. Once we abandon the interests of sentient
creatures as our source of value, where do we find value?
What is good or bad for nonsentient creatures, and why does
it matter?
It might be thought that as long as we limit ourselves to living
things, the answer is not too difficult to find. We know what
is good or bad for the plants in our garden: water, sunlight, and
compost are good; extremes of heat or cold are bad. The same
applies to plants in any forest or wilderness, so why not regard
their flourishing as good in itself, independently of its usefulness
to sentient creatures?
One problem here is that without conscious interests to guide
us, we have no way of assessing the relative weights to be given
to the flourishing of different forms of life. Is a two-thousandyear-old Huon pine more worthy of preservation than a tussock
of grass? Most people will say that it is, but such a judgment
seems to have more to do with our feelings of awe for the age,
277 

size, and beauty of the tree, or with the length of time it would
take to replace it, than with our perception of some intrinsic
value in the flourishing of an old tree that is not possessed by
a young grass tussock.
If we cease talking in terms of sentience, the boundary
between living and inanimate natural objects becomes more
difficult to defend. Would it really be worse to cut down an
old tree than to destroy a beautiful stalactite that has taken
even longer to grow? On what grounds could such a judgment
be made? Probably the best known defence of an ethic that
extends to all living things is that of Albert Schweitzer. The
phrase he used, 'reverence for life', is often quoted; the arguments he offered in support of such a position are less wellknown. Here is one of the few passages in which he defended
his ethic:
True philosophy must commence with the most immediate and
comprehensive farts of consciousness. And this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the
midst of life which wills to live.'... Just as in my own will-tolive there is a yearning for more life, and for that mysterious
exaltation of the will which is called pleasure, and terror in face
of annihilation and that injury to the will-to-live which is called
pain; so the same obtains in all the will-to-live around me,
equally whether it can express itself to my comprehension or
whether it remains unvoiced.
Ethics thus consists in this, that I experience the necessity of
practising the same reverence for life toward all will-to-live, as
toward my own. Therein I have already the needed fundamental
principle of morality. It is good to maintain and cherish life; it
is evil to destroy and to check life. A man is really ethical only
when he obeys the constraint laid on him to help all life which
he is able to succour, and when he goes out of his way to avoid
injuring anything living. He does not ask how far this or that
life deserves sympathy as valuable in itself, nor how far it is
capable of feeling. To him life as such is sacred. He shatters no
ice crystal that sparkles in the sun, tears no leaf from its tree,
breaks off no flower, and is careful not to crush any insect as he
278 

walks. If he works by lamplight on a summer evening he prefers
to keep the window shut and to breathe stifling air, rather than
to see insect after insect fall on his table with singed and sinking
wings.
A similar view has been defended recently by the contemporary
American philosopher Paul Taylor. In his book Respect for
Nature, Taylor argues that every living thing is 'pursuing its
own good in its own unique way.' Once we see this, we can
see all living things 'as we see ourselves' and therefore 'we
are ready to place the same value on their existence as we
do on our own'.
It is not clear how we should interpret Schweitzer's position.
The reference to the ice crystal is especially puzzling, for an ice
crystal is not alive at all. Putting this aside, however, the problem
with the defences offered by both Schweitzer and Taylor for
their ethical views is that they use language metaphorically and
then argue as if what they had said was literally true. We may
often talk about plants 'seeking' water or light so that they can
survive, and this way of thinking about plants makes it easier
to accept talk of their 'will to live', or of them 'pursuing' their
own good. But once we stop to reflect on the fact that plants
are not conscious and cannot engage in any intentional behaviour, it is clear that all this language is metaphorical; one might
just as well say that a river is pursuing its own good and striving
to reach the sea, or .that the 'good' of a guided missile is to blow
itself up along with its target. It is misleading of Schweitzer to
attempt to sway us towards an ethic of reverence for all life
by referring to 'yearning', 'exaltation', 'pleasure', and 'terror'.
Plants experience none of these.
Moreover, in the case of plants, rivers, and guided missiles,
it is possible to give a purely physical explanation of what is
happening; and in the absence of consciousness, there is no
good reason why we should have greater respect for the physical
processes that govern the growth and decay of living things than
we have for those that govern non-living things. This being so,
279 

it is at least not obvious why we should have greater reverence
for a tree than for a stalactite, or for a single-celled organism
than for a mountain.
DEEP ECOLOGY
More than forty years ago the American ecologist Aldo Leopold
wrote that there was a need for a 'new ethic', an 'ethic dealing
with man's relation to land and to the animals and plants which
grow upon it'. His proposed 'land ethic' would enlarge 'the
boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants,
and animals, or collectively, the land'. The rise of ecological
concern in the early 1970s led to a revival of interest in this
attitude. The Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess wrote a brief
but influential article distinguishing between 'shallow' and
'deep' strands in the ecological movement. Shallow ecological
thinking was limited to the traditional moral framework; those
who thought in this way were anxious to avoid pollution to
our water supply so that we could have safe water to drink,
and they sought to preserve wilderness so that people could
continue to enjoy walking through it. Deep ecologists, on the
other hand, wanted to preserve the integrity of the biosphere
for its own sake, irrespective of the possible benefits to humans
that might flow from so doing. Subsequently several other writers have attempted to develop some form of 'deep' environmental theory.
Where the reverence for life ethic emphasises individual living
organisms, proposals for deep ecology ethics tend to take something larger as the object of value: species, ecological systems,
even the biosphere as a whole. Leopold summed up the basis
of his new land ethic thus: 'A thing is right when it tends to
preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.' In a paper published in 1984, Arne Naess and George Sessions, an American
philosopher involved in the deep ecology movement, set out
280 

several principles for a deep ecological ethic, beginning with the
following:
1 The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human Life
on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: intrinsic value,
inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the non-human world for human purposes.
2 Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realisation
of these values and are also values in themselves.
3 Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity
except to satisfy vital needs.
Although these principles refer only to life, in the same paper
Naess and Sessions say that deep ecology uses the term 'biosphere' in a more comprehensive way, to refer also to nonliving things such as rivers (watersheds), landscapes, and
ecosystems. Two Australians working at the deep end of environmental ethics, Richard Sylvan and Val Plumwood, also
extend their ethic beyond living things, including in it an obligation 'not to jeopardise the well-being of natural objects or
systems without good reason'.
In the previous section I quoted Paul Taylor's remark to the
effect that we should be ready not merely to respect every living
thing, but to place the same value on the life of every living
thing as we place on our own. This is a common theme among
deep ecologists, often extended beyond living things. In Deep
Ecology Bill Devall and George Sessions defend a form of 'biocentric egalitarianism':
The intuition of biocentric equality is that all things in the biosphere have an equal right to live and blossom and to reach their
own individual forms of unfolding and self-realisation within the
larger Self-realisation. This basic intuition is that all organisms
and entities in the ecosphere, as parts of the interrelated whole,
are equal in intrinsic worth.
If, as this quotation appears to suggest, this biocentric equality
rests on a 'basic intuition', it is up against some strong intuitions
that point in the opposite direction - for example, the intuition
281 

that the rights to 'live and blossom' of normal adult humans
ought to be preferred over those of yeasts, and the rights of
gorillas over those of grasses. If, however, the point is that
humans, gorillas, yeasts, and grasses are all parts of an interrelated whole, then it can still be asked how this establishes that
they are equal in intrinsic worth. Is it because every living thing
plays its role in an ecosystem on which all depend for their
survival? But, firstly, even if this showed that there is intrinsic
worth in micro-organisms and plants as a whole, it says nothing
at all about the value of individual micro-organisms or plants,
since no individual is necessary for the survival of the ecosystem
as a whole. Secondly, the fact that all organisms are part of an
interrelated whole does not suggest that they are all of intrinsic
worth, let alone of equal intrinsic worth. They may be of worth
only because they are needed for the existence of the whole,
and the whole may be of worth only because it supports the
existence of conscious beings.
The ethics of deep ecology thus fail to yield persuasive answers
to questions about the value of the lives of individual living
beings. Perhaps, though, this is the wrong kind of question to
ask. As the science of ecology looks at systems rather than
individual organisms, so ecological ethics might be more plausible if applied at a higher level, perhaps at the level of species
and ecosystems. Behind many attempts to derive values from
ecological ethics at this level lies some form of holism - some
sense that the species or ecosystem is not just a collection of
individuals, but really an entity in its own right. This holism is
made explicit in Lawrence Johnson's A Morally Deep World.
Johnson is quite prepared to talk about the interests of a species,
in a sense that is distinct from the sum of the interests of each
member of the species, and to argue that the interests of a
species, or an ecosystem, ought to be taken into account, alongside individual interests, in our moral deliberations. In The Ecological Self, Freya Mathews contends that any 'self-realising
system' has intrinsic value in that it seeks to maintain or preserve
282 

itself. While living organisms are paradigm examples of selfrealising systems, Mathews, like Johnson, includes species and
ecosystems as holistic entities or selves with their own form of
realisation. She even includes the entire global ecosystem, following James Lovelock in referring to it by the name of the
Greek goddess of the earth, Gaia. On this basis she defends her
own form of biocentric egalitarianism.
There is, of course, a real philosophical question about
whether a species or an ecosystem can be considered as the sort
of individual that can have interests, or a 'self' to be realised;
and even if it can, the deep ecology ethic will face problems
similar to those we identified in considering the idea of reverence for life. For it is necessary, not merely that trees, species,
and ecosystems can properly be said to have interests, but that
they have morally significant interests. If they are to be regarded
as 'selves' it will need to be shown that the survival or realisation
of that kind of self has moral value, independently of the value
it has because of its importance in sustaining conscious life.
We saw in discussing the ethic of reverence for life that one
way of establishing that an interest is morally significant is to
ask what it is like for the entity affected to have that interest
unsatisfied. The same question can be asked about selfrealisation: what is it like for the self to remain unrealised? Such
questions yield intelligible answers when asked of sentient
beings, but not when asked of trees, species, or ecosystems. The
fact that, as James Lovelock points out in Gaia: A New Look at
Life on Earth, the biosphere can respond to events in ways that
resemble a self-maintaining system, does not in itself show that
the biosphere consciously desires to maintain itself. Calling the
global ecosystem by the name of a Greek goddess seems a nice
idea, but it may not be the best way of helping us to think
clearly about its nature. Similarly, on a smaller scale, there is
nothing that corresponds to what it feels like to be an ecosystem
flooded by a dam, because there is no such feeling. In this respect
trees, ecosystems, and species are more like rocks than they are
283 

like sentient beings; so the divide between sentient and nonsentient creatures is to that extent a firmer basis for a morally
important boundary than the divide between living and nonliving things, or between holistic entities and any other entities
that we might not regard as holistic. (Whatever these other
entities could be: even a single atom is, when seen from the
appropriate level, a complex system that 'seeks' to maintain
itself.)
This rejection of the ethical basis for a deep ecology ethic does
not mean that the case for the preservation of wilderness is not
strong. All it means is that one kind of argument - the argument
from the intrinsic value of the plants, species, or ecosystems -
is, at best, problematic. Unless it can be placed on a different,
and firmer footing, we should confine ourselves to arguments
based on the interests of sentient creatures, present and future,
human and non-human. These arguments are quite sufficient
to show that, at least in a society where no one needs to destroy
wilderness in order to obtain food for survival or materials for
shelter from the elements, the value of preserving the remaining
significant areas of wilderness greatly exceeds the economic
values gained by its destruction.
DEVELOPING AN ENVIRONMENTAL ETHIC
In the long run, the set of ethical virtues praised and the set of
ethical prohibitions adopted by the ethic of specific societies will
always reflect the conditions under which they must live and
work in order to survive. That statement is close to being a
tautology, because if a society's ethic did not take into account
whatever was needed for survival, the society would cease to
exist. Many of the ethical standards that we accept today can
be explained in these terms. Some are universal and can be
expected to be beneficial to the community in virtually any
conditions in which humans live. Obviously a society in which
members of the community are permitted to kill each other with
284 

impunity would not last long. Conversely, the parental virtues
of caring for children, and other virtues like honesty, or loyalty
to the group, would foster a stable and lasting community. Other
prohibitions may reflect specific conditions: the practice among
the Eskimo of killing elderly parents no longer able to fend for
themselves, is often cited as a necessary response to life in a
very harsh climate. No doubt the slow pace of changing climatic
conditions, or of migration to different regions, allowed time
for systems of ethics to make the necessary adjustment.
Now we face a new threat to our survival. The proliferation
of human beings, coupled with the by-products of economic
growth, is just as capable as the old threats of wiping out our
society - and every other society as well. No ethic has yet developed to cope with this threat. Some ethical principles that
we do have are exactly the opposite of what we need. The
problem is that, as we have already seen, ethical principles
change slowly and the time we have left to develop a new
environmental ethic is short. Such an ethic would regard every
action that is harmful to the environment as ethically dubious,
and those that are unnecessarily harmful as plainly wrong. That
is the serious point behind my remark in the first chapter that
the moral issues raised by driving a car are more serious than
those raised by sexual behaviour. An environmental ethic would
find virtue in saving and recycling resources, and vice in extravagance and unnecessary consumption. To take just one example: from the perspective of an environmental ethic, our
choice of recreation is not ethically neutral. At present we see
the choice between motor car racing or cycling, between water
skiing or windsurfing, as merely a matter of taste. Yet there is
an essential difference: motor car racing and water skiing require
the consumption of fossil fuels and the discharge of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere. Cycling and windsurfing do not.
Once we take the need to preserve our environment seriously,
motor racing and water skiing will no more be an acceptable
form of entertainment than bear-baiting is today.
285 

The broad outlines of a truly environmental ethic are easy to
discern. At its most fundamental level, such an ethic fosters
consideration for the interests of all sentient creatures, including
subsequent generations stretching into the far future. It is accompanied by an aesthetic of appreciation for wild places and
unspoiled nature. At a more detailed level, applicable to the
lives of dwellers in cities and towns, it discourages large families.
(Here it forms a sharp contrast to some existing ethical beliefs
that are relics of an age in which the earth was far more lightly
populated; it also offers a counterweight to the implication of
the 'total' version of utilitarianism discussed in Chapter 4.) An
environmental ethic rejects the ideals of a materialist society in
which success is gauged by the number of consumer goods one
can accumulate. Instead it judges success in terms of the development of one's abilities and the achievement of real fulfilment and satisfaction. It promotes frugality, in so far as that is
necessary for minimising pollution and ensuring that everything
that can be re-used is re-used. Carelessly to throw out material
that can be recycled is a form of vandalism or the theft of our
common property in the resources of the world. Thus the various 'green consumer' guides and books about things we can
do to save our planet - recycling what we use and buying the
most environmentally friendly products available - are part of
the new ethic that is required. Even they may prove to be only
an interim solution, a stepping-stone to an ethic in which the
very idea of consuming unnecessary products is questioned.
Wind-surfing may be better than water-skiing, but if we keep
on buying new boards in order to be up to date with the latest
trends in board and sail designs, the difference is only marginal.
We must re-assess our notion of extravagance. In a world
under pressure, this concept is not confined to chauffeured limousines and Dom Perignon champagne. Timber that has come
from a rainforest is extravagant, because the long-term value
of the rainforest is far greater than the uses to which the timber
is put. Disposable paper products are extravagant, because an286 

cient hardwood forests are being converted into wood-chips
and sold to paper manufacturers. 'Going for a drive in the country' is an extravagant use of fossil fuels that contributes to the
greenhouse effect. During the Second World War, when petrol
was scarce, posters asked: 'Is your journey really necessary?'
The appeal to national solidarity against a visible and immediate
danger was highly effective. The danger to our environment is
less immediate and much harder to see, but the need to cut out
unnecessary journeys and other forms of unnecessary consumption is just as great.
As far as food is concerned, the great extravagance is not
caviar or truffles, but beef, pork, and poultry. Some 38 per cent
of the world's grain crop is now fed to animals, as well as large
quantities of soybeans. There are three times as many domestic
animals on this planet as there are human beings. The combined
weight of the world's 1.28 billion cattle alone exceeds that of
the human population. While we look darkly at the number of
babies being born in poorer parts of the world, we ignore the
over-population of farm animals, to which we ourselves contribute. The prodigious waste of grain that is fed to intensively
farmed animals has already been mentioned in Chapters 3 and
8. That, however, is only part of the damage done by the animals
we deliberately breed. The energy-intensive factory farming
methods of the industrialised nations are responsible for the
consumption of huge amounts of fossil fuels. Chemical fertilisers, used to grow the feed crops for cattle in feedlots and pigs
and chickens kept indoors in sheds, produce nitrous oxide, another greenhouse gas. Then there is the loss of forests. Everywhere, forest dwellers, both human and non-human, are being
pushed out. Since 1960, 25 per cent of the forests of Central
America have been cleared for cattle. Once cleared, the poor
soils will support grazing for a few years; then the graziers must
move on. Scrub takes over the abandoned pasture, but the forest
does not return. When the forests are cleared so that cattle can
graze, billions of tons of carbon dioxide are released into the
287 

atmosphere. Finally, the world's cattle are thought to produce
about 20 per cent of the methane released into the atmosphere,
and methane traps twenty-five times as much heat from the
sun as carbon dioxide. Factory farm manure also produces
methane because, unlike manured dropped naturally in the
fields, it does not decompose in the presence of oxygen. All of
this amounts to a compelling reason, additional to that developed in Chapter 3, for a largely plant-based diet.
The emphasis on frugality and a simple life does not mean
that an environmental ethic frowns upon pleasure, but that the
pleasures it values do not come from conspicuous consumption.
They come, instead, from warm personal and sexual relationships, from being close to children and friends, from conversation, from sports and recreations that are in harmony with
our environment instead of being harmful to it; from food that
is not based on the exploitation of sentient creatures and does
not cost the earth; from creative activity and work of all kinds;
and (with due care so as not to ruin precisely what is valued)
from appreciating the unspoiled places in the world in which
we live.

ENDS AND MEANS
WE have examined a number of ethical issues. We have
seen that many accepted practices are open to serious
objections. What ought we to do about it? This, too, is an ethical
issue. Here are four actual cases to consider.
Oskar Schindler was a German industrialist. During the war
he ran a factory near Cracow, in Poland. At a time when Polish
Jews were being sent to death camps, he assembled a labour
force of Jewish inmates from concentration camps and the
ghetto, considerably larger than his factory needed, and used
several illegal strategems, including bribing members of the SS
and other officials, to protect them. He spent his own money
to buy food on the black market to supplement the inadequate
official rations he obtained for his workers. By these methods
he was able to save the lives of about 1,200 people.
In 1984 Dr Thomas Gennarelli directed a Head Injury
Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.
Members of an underground organisation called the Animal
Liberation Front knew that Gennarelli inflicted head injuries
on monkeys there and had been told that the monkeys underwent the experiments without being properly anaesthetised.
They also knew that Gennarelli and his collaborators videotaped their experiments, to provide a record of what happened
during and after the injuries they inflicted. They tried to obtain
further information through official channels but were unsuccessful. In May 1984, they broke into the laboratory at
289 

night and found thirty-four videotapes. They then systematically destroyed laboratory equipment before leaving with the
tapes. The tapes clearly showed conscious monkeys struggling
as they were being strapped to an operating table where head
injuries were inflicted; they also showed experimenters mocking and laughing at frightened animals about to be used in
experiments. When an edited version of the tapes was released
to the public, it produced widespread revulsion. Nevertheless, it took a further year of protests, culminating in a sitin at the headquarters of the government organisation that
was funding Gennarelli's experiments, before the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services ordered the experiments
stopped.
In 1986 Joan Andrews entered an abortion clinic in Pensacola,
Florida, and damaged a suction abortion apparatus. She refused to be represented in court, on the grounds that 'the true
defendants, the pre-born children, received none, and were
killed without due process'. Andrews was a supporter of Operation Rescue, an American organisation that takes its name,
and its authority to act, from the biblical injunction to 'rescue
those who are drawn toward death and hold back those stumbling to the slaughter'. Operation Rescue uses civil disobedience to shut down abortion clinics, thus, in its view, 'sparing
the lives of unborn babies whom the Rescuers are morally
pledged to defend'. Participants block the doors of the clinics
to prevent physicians and pregnant women seeking abortion
from entering. They attempt to dissuade pregnant women from
approaching the clinic by 'sidewalk counselling' on the nature
of abortion. Gary Leber, an Operation Rescue director, has
said that, between 1987 and 1989 alone, as a direct result of
such 'rescue missions', at least 421 women changed their
minds about having abortions, and the children of these
women, who would have been killed, are alive today.
290 

In 1976 Bob Brown, then a young medical practitioner, rafted
down the Franklin river, in Tasmania's southwest. The wild
beauty of the river and the peace of the undisturbed forests
around it impressed him deeply. Then, around a bend on the
lower reaches of the river, he came across workers for the
Hydro-Electric Commission, studying the feasibility of building a dam across the river. Brown gave up his medical practice
and founded the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, with the object
of protecting the state's remaining wilderness areas. Despite
vigorous campaigning, the Hydro-Electric Commission recommended the building of the dam, and after some vacillation the
state government, with support both from the business community and the labour unions, decided to go ahead. The Tasmanian Wilderness Society organized a non-violent blockade
of the road being built to the dam site. In 1982, Brown, along
with many others, was arrested and jailed for four days for
trespassing on land controlled by the Hydro-Electric Commission. But the blockade became a focus of national attention,
and although the Australian federal government was not directly responsible for the dam, it became an issue in the federal
election that was then due. The Australian Labor Party, in opposition before the election, pledged to explore constitutional
means of preventing the dam from going ahead. The election
saw the Labor party elected to office, and legislation passed to
stop the dam. Though challenged by the Tasmanian government, the legislation was upheld by a narrow majority of the
High Court of Australia on the grounds that the Tasmanian
southwest was a World Heritage area, and the federal government had constitutional powers to uphold the international
treaty creating the World Heritage Commission. Today the
Franklin still runs free.
Do we have an overriding obligation to obey the law? Oskar
Schindler, the members of the Animal Liberation Front who
291 

took Gennarelli's videotapes, Joan Andrews of Operation Rescue, and Bob Brown and those who joined him in front of the
bulldozers in Tasmania's southwest were all breaking the law.
Were they all acting wrongly?
The question cannot be dealt with by invoking the simplistic
formula: 'the end never justifies the means'. For all but the
strictest adherent of an ethic of rules, the end sometimes does
justify the means. Most people think that lying is wrong, other
things being equal, yet think it right to lie in order to avoid
causing unnecessary offence or embarrassment - for instance,
when a well-meaning relative gives you a hideous vase for your
birthday, and then asks if you really like it. If this relatively
trivial end can justify lying, it is even more obvious that some
important end - preventing a murder, or saving animals from
great suffering - can justify lying. Thus the principle that the
end cannot justify the means is easily breached. The difficult
issue is not whether the end can ever justify the means, but
which means are justified by which ends.
INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE AND THE LAW
There are many people who are opposed to damming wild
rivers, to the exploitation of animals, or to abortion, but who
do not break the law in order to stop these activities. No doubt
some members of the more conventional conservation, animal
liberation, and anti-abortion organizations do not commit illegal
acts because they do not wish to be fined or imprisoned; but
others would be prepared to take the consequences of illegal
acts. They refrain only because they respect and obey the moral
authority of the law.
Who is right in this ethical disagreement? Are we under any
moral obligation to obey the law, if the law protects and sanctions things we hold utterly wrong? A clear-cut answer to this
question was given by the nineteenth-century American radical,
292 

Henry Thoreau. In his essay entitled 'Civil Disobedience' - perhaps the first use of this now-familiar phrase - he wrote:
Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign
his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience,
then? I think we should be men first and subjects afterwards. It
is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for
the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume, is
to do at any time what I think right.
The American philosopher Robert Paul Wolff has written in
similar vein:
The defining mark of the state is authority, the right to rule. The
primary obligation of man is autonomy, the refusal to be ruled,
It would seem, then, that there can be no resolution of the conflict
between the autonomy of the individual and the putative authority of the state. Insofar as a man fulfills his obligation to
make himself the author of his decisions, he will resist the state's
claim to have authority over him.
Thoreau and Wolff resolve the conflict between individual and
society in favour of the individual. We should do as our conscience dictates, as we autonomously decide we ought to do:
not as the law directs. Anything else would be a denial of our
capacity for ethical choice.
Thus stated, the issue looks straightforward and the ThoreauWolff answer obviously right. So Oskar Schindler, the Animal
Liberation Front, Joan Andrews, and Bob Brown were fully
justified in doing what they saw to be right, rather than what
the state laid down as lawful. But is it that simple? There is a
sense in which it is undeniable that, as Thoreau says, we ought
to do what we think right; or, as Wolff puts it, make ourselves
the authors of our decisions. Faced with a choice between doing
what we think right and what we think wrong, of course we
ought to do what we think right. But this, though true, is not
much help. What we need to know is not whether we should
do what we decide to be right, but how we should decide what
is right.
293 

Think about the difference of opinion between members of
groups like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and more lawabiding members of an organization like Britain's Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA): ALF members think inflicting pain on animals is, unless justified by extraordinary circumstances, wrong, and if the best way to stop
it is by breaking the law then they think that breaking the law
is right. RSPCA members - let us assume - also think that
inflicting pain on animals is normally wrong, but they think
breaking the law is wrong, too, and they think that the wrongness of breaking the law cannot be justified by the goal of stopping the unjustifiable infliction of pain on animals. Now suppose
there are people opposed to inflicting pain on animals who are
uncertain whether they should join the militant lawbreakers or
the more orthodox animal welfare group. How does telling these
people to do what they think right, or to be the author of their
own decisions, resolve their uncertainty? The uncertainty is an
uncertainty about what is the right thing to do, not about
whether to do what one has decided to be right.
This point can be obscured by talk of 'following one's conscience' irrespective of what the law commands. Some who talk
of 'following conscience' mean no more than doing what, on
reflection, one thinks right - and this may, as in the case of our
imagined RSPCA members, depend on what the law commands. Others mean by 'conscience' not something dependent
on critical reflective judgment, but a kind of internal voice that
tells us that something is wrong and may continue to tell us
this despite our careful reflective decision, based on all the relevant ethical considerations, that the action is not wrong. In
this sense of 'conscience' an unmarried woman brought up as
a strict Roman Catholic to believe that sex outside marriage is
always wrong may abandon her religion and come to hold that
there is no sound basis for restricting sex to marriage - yet
continue to feel guilty when she has sex. She may refer to these
294 

guilt feelings as her 'conscience' but if that is her conscience,
should she follow it?
To say that we should follow our conscience is unobjectionable - and unhelpful - when 'following conscience' means
doing what, on reflection, one thinks right. When 'following
conscience' means doing as one's 'internal voice' prompts one
to do, however, to follow one's conscience is to abdicate one's
responsibility as a rational agent, to fail to take all the relevant
factors into account and act on one's best judgment of the rights
and wrongs of the situation. The 'internal voice' is more likely
to be a product of one's upbringing and education than a source
of genuine ethical insight.
Presumably neither Thoreau nor Wolff wish to suggest that
we should always follow our conscience in the 'internal voice'
sense. They must mean, if their views are to be at all plausible,
that we should follow our judgment about what we ought to
do. In this case the most that can be said for their recommendations is that they remind us that decisions about obeying the
law are ethical decisions that the law itself cannot settle for us.
We should not assume, without reflection, that if the law prohibits, say, stealing videotapes from laboratories, it is always
wrong to do so - any more than we should assume that if the
law prohibits hiding Jews from the Nazis, it is wrong to do so.
Law and ethics are distinct. At the same time, this does not
mean that the law carries no moral weight. It does not mean
that any action that would have been right if it had been legal
must be right although it is in fact illegal. That an action is illegal
may be of ethical, as well as legal, significance. Whether it really
is ethically significant is a separate question.
LAW AND ORDER
If we think that a practice is seriously wrong, and if we have
the courage and ability to disrupt this practice by breaking the
295 

law, how could the illegality of this action provide an ethical
reason against it? To answer a question as specific as this, we
should first ask a more general one: why have laws at all?
Human beings are social in nature, but not so social that we
do not need to protect ourselves against the risk of being assaulted or killed by our fellow humans. We might try to do this
by forming vigilante organizations to prevent assaults and punish those who commit them; but the results would be haphazard
and liable to grow into gang warfare. Thus it is desirable to
have, as John Locke said long ago, 'an established, settled,
known law', interpreted by an authoritative judge and backed
with sufficient power to carry out the judge's decisions.
If people voluntarily refrained from assaulting others, or acting
in other ways inimical to a harmonious and happy social existence, we might manage without judges and sanctions. We
would still need law-like conventions about such matters as
which side of the road one drives on. Even an anarchist Utopia
would have some settled principles of cooperation. So we would
have something rather like law. In reality, not everyone is going
to voluntarily refrain from behaviour, like assaults, that others
cannot tolerate. Nor is it only the danger of individual acts like
assaults that make law necessary. In any society there will be disputes: about how much water farmers may take from the river to
irrigate their crops, about the ownership of land, or the custody
of a child, about the control of pollution, and the level of taxation. Some settled decision-procedure is necessary for resolving
such disputes economically and speedily, or else the parties to the
dispute are likely to resort to force. Almost any established decision-procedure is better than a resort to force, for when force is
used people get hurt. Moreover, most decision-procedures produce results at least as beneficial and just as a resort to force.
So laws and a settled decision-procedure to generate them
are a good thing. This gives rise to one important reason for
obeying the law. By obeying the law, I can contribute to the
296 

respect in which the established decision-procedure and the
laws are held. By disobeying I set an example to others that
may lead them to disobey too. The effect may multiply and
contribute to a decline in law and order. In an extreme case it
may lead to civil war.
A second reason for obedience follows immediately from this
first. If law is to be effective - outside the anarchist's Utopia -
there must be some machinery for detecting and penalizing lawbreakers. This machinery will cost something to maintain and
operate, and the cost will have to be met by the community. If
I break the law the community will be put to the expense of
enforcement.
These two reasons for obeying the law are neither universally
applicable nor conclusive. They are not, for instance, applicable
to breaches of the law that remain secret. If, late at night when
the streets are deserted, I cross the road against the red light,
there is no one to be led into disobedience by my example, and
no one to enforce the law against so crossing. But this is not
the kind of illegality we are interested in.
Where they are applicable, these two reasons for obedience
are not conclusive, because there are times when the reasons
against obeying a particular law are more important than the
risks of encouraging others to disobey or the costs to the community of enforcing the law. They are genuine reasons for obeying, and in the absence of reasons for disobeying, are sufficient
to resolve the issue in favour of obedience; but where there are
conflicting reasons, we must assess each case on its merits in
order to see if the reasons for disobeying outweigh these reasons
for obedience. If, for instance, illegal acts were the only way of
preventing many painful experiments on animals, of saving significant areas of wilderness, or of prodding governments into
increasing overseas aid, the importance of the ends would justify
running some risk of contributing to a general decline in obedience to law.
297 

DEMOCRACY
At this point some will say: the difference between Oskar Schindler's heroic deeds and the indefensible illegal actions of the
Animal Liberation Front, Operation Rescue, and the opponents
of the Franklin dam is that in Nazi Germany there were no legal
channels that Schindler could use to bring about change. In a
democracy there are legal means of ending abuses. The existence
of legal procedures for changing the law makes the use of illegal
means unjustifiable.
It is true that in democratic societies there are legal procedures
that can be used by those seeking reforms; but this in itself does
not show that the use of illegal means is wrong. Legal channels
may exist, but the prospects of using them to bring about change
in the foreseeable future may be very poor. While one makes
slow and painful progress - or perhaps no progress at all -
through these legal channels, the indefensible wrongs one is
trying to stop will be continuing. Prior to the successful struggle
to save the Franklin River, an earlier political campaign had
been fought against another dam proposed by the Tasmanian
Hydro-Electric Commission. This dam was opposed because it
would flood a pristine alpine lake, Lake Peddar, situated in a
national park. This campaign employed more orthodox political
tactics. It failed, and Lake Peddar disappeared under the waters
of the dam. Dr Thomas Gennarelli's laboratory had carried out
experiments for several years before the Animal Liberation Front
raided it. Without the evidence of the stolen videotapes, it would
probably still be functioning today. Similarly, Operation Rescue
was founded after fourteen years of more conventional political
action had failed to reverse the permissive legal situation regarding abortion that has existed in the United States since the
Supreme Court declared restrictive abortion laws unconstitutional in 1973. During that period, according to Operation Rescue's Gary Leber, 'twenty-five million Americans have been
"legally" killed'. From this perspective it is easy to see why the
298 

existence of legal channels for change does not solve the moral
dilemma. An extremely remote possibility of legal change is not
a strong reason against using means more likely to succeed. The
most that can follow from the mere existence of legitimate channels is that, since we cannot know whether they will prove
successful until we have tried them, their existence is a reason
for postponing illegal acts until legal means have been tried and
have failed.
Here the upholder of democratic laws can try another tack:
if legal means fail to bring about reform, it shows that the
proposed reform does not have the approval of the majority of
the electorate; and to attempt to implement the reform by illegal
means against the wishes of the majority would be a violation
of the central principle of democracy, majority rule.
The militant can challenge this argument on two grounds,
one factual and the other philosophical. The factual claim in
the democrat's argument is that a reform that cannot be implemented by legal means lacks the approval of the majority of
the electorate. Perhaps this would hold in a direct democracy,
in which the whole electorate voted on each issue; but it is
certainly not always true of modern representative democracies.
There is no way of ensuring that on any given issue a majority
of representatives will take the same view as a majority of their
constituents. One can be reasonably confident that a majority
of those Americans who saw, on television, excerpts from Gennarelli's videotapes would not have supported the experiments.
But that is not how decisions are made in a democracy. In
choosing between representatives - or in choosing between political parties - voters elect to take one 'package deal' in preference to other package deals on offer. It will often happen that
in order to vote for policies they favour, voters must go along
with other policies they are not keen on. It will also happen
that policies voters favour are not offered by any major party.
In the case of abortion in the United States, the crucial decision
was not made by a majority of voters, but by the Supreme Court.
299 

It cannot be overturned by a simple majority of the electors, but
only by the Court itself, or by the complicated procedure of a
constitutional amendment, which can be thwarted by a minority
of the electorate.
What if a majority did approve of the wrong that the militants
wish to stop? Would it then be wrong to use illegal means?
Here we have the philosophical claim underlying the democratic
argument for obedience, the claim that we ought to accept the
majority decision.
The case for majority rule should not be overstated. No sensible democrat would claim that the majority is always right. If
49 per cent of the population can be wrong, so can 51 per cent.
Whether the majority supports the views of the Animal Liberation Front or of Operation Rescue does not settle the question
whether these views are morally sound.Perhaps the fact that
these groups are in a minority - if they are - means that they
should reconsider their means. With a majority behind them,
they could claim to be acting with democratic principles on their
side, using illegal means to overcome flaws in the democratic
machinery. Without that majority, all the weight of democratic
tradition is against them and it is they who appear as coercers,
trying to force the majority into accepting something against its
will. But how much moral weight should we give to democratic
principles?
Thoreau, as we might expect, was not impressed by majority
decision making. 'All voting,' he wrote, 'is a sort of gaming,
like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral tinge to it, a
playing with right and wrong, with moral questions.' In a sense
Thoreau was right. If we reject, as we must, the doctrine that
the majority is always right, to submit moral issues to the vote
is to gamble that what we believe to be right will come out of
the ballot with more votes behind it than what we believe to
be wrong; and that is a gamble we will often lose.
Nevertheless we should not be too contemptuous about voting, or gambling either. Cowboys who agree to play poker to
300 

decide matters of honour do better than cowboys who continue
to settle such matters in the traditional Western manner. A
society that decides its controversial issues by ballots does better
than one that uses bullets. To some extent this is a point we
have already encountered, under the heading 'law and order'.
It applies to any society with an established, peaceful method
of resolving disputes; but in a democracy there is a subtle difference that gives added weight to the outcome of the decisionprocedure. A method of settling disputes in which no one has
greater ultimate power than anyone else is a method that can
be recommended to all as a fair compromise between competing
claims to power. Any other method must give greater power to
some than to others and thereby invites opposition from those
w ho have less. That, at least, is true in the egalitarian age in
which we live. In a feudal society in which people accept as
natural and proper their status as lord or vassal there is no
challenge to the feudal lord and no compromise would be
needed. (I am thinking of an ideal feudal system, as I am thinking of an ideal democracy.) Those times, however, seem to be
gone forever. The breakdown of traditional authority created a
need for political compromise. Among possible compromises,
giving one vote to each person is uniquely acceptable to all. As
such, in the absence of any agreed procedure for deciding on
some other distribution of power, it offers, in principle, the
firmest possible basis for a peaceful method of settling disputes.
To reject majority rule, therefore, is to reject the best possible
basis for the peaceful ordering of society in an egalitarian age.
Where else should one turn? To a meritocratic franchise, with
extra votes for the more intelligent or better educated, as John
Stuart Mill once proposed? But could we agree on who merits
extra votes? To a benevolent despot? Many would accept that
- if they could choose the despot. In practice the likely outcome
of abandoning majority rule is none of these: it is the rule of
those who command the greatest force.
So the principle of majority rule does carry substantial moral
301 

weight. Disobedience is easier to justify in a dictatorship like
Nazi Germany than in a democracy like those of North America,
Europe, India, Japan, or Australia today. In a democracy we
should be reluctant to take any action that amounts to an attempt to coerce the majority, for such attempts imply the rejection of majority rule and there is no acceptable alternative
to that. There may, of course, be cases where the majority decision is so appalling that coercion is justified, whatever the risk.
The obligation to obey a genuine majority decision is not absolute. We show our respect for the principle not by blind obedience to the majority, but by regarding ourselves as justified
in disobeying only in extreme circumstances.
DISOBEDIENCE, CIVIL OR OTHERWISE
If we draw together our conclusions on the use of illegal means
to achieve laudable ends, we shall find that: (1) there are reasons
why we should normally accept the verdict of an established
peaceful method of settling disputes; (2) these reasons are particularly strong when the decision-procedure is democratic and
the verdict represents a genuine majority view; but (3) there
are still situations in which the use of illegal means can be
justified.
We have seen that there are two distinct ways in which one
might try to justify the use of illegal means in a society that is
democratic (even if imperfectly so, as, to varying degrees, existing democracies are). The first is on the grounds that the
decision one is objecting to is not a genuine expression of majority opinion. The second is that although the decision is a
genuine expression of the majority view, this view is so seriously
wrong that action against the majority is justified.
It is disobedience on the first ground that best merits the name
'civil disobedience'. Here the use of illegal means can be regarded as an extension of the use of legal means to secure a
302 

genuinely democratic decision. The extension may be necessary
because the normal channels for securing reform are not working properly. On some issues parliamentary representatives are
overly influenced by skilled and well-paid special interests. On
others the public is unaware of what is happening. Perhaps the
abuse requires administrative, rather than legislative change,
and the bureaucrats of the civil service have refused to be inconvenienced. Perhaps the legitimate interests of a minority are
being ignored by prejudiced officials. In all these cases, the nowstandard forms of civil disobedience - passive resistance,
marches, or sit-ins - are appropriate. The blockade of the HydroElectric Commission's road into the site of the proposed Franklin
river dam was a classic case of civil disobedience in this sense.
In these situations disobeying the law is not an attempt to
coerce the majority. Instead disobedience attempts to inform the
majority; or to persuade parliamentarians that large numbers
of electors feel very strongly about the issue; or to draw national
attention to an issue previously left to bureaucrats; or to appeal
for reconsideration of a decision too hastily made. Civil disobedience is an appropriate means to these ends when legal
means have failed, because, although it is illegal, it does not
threaten the majority or attempt to coerce them (though it will
usually impose some extra costs on them, for example for law
enforcement). By not resisting the force of the law, by remaining
non-violent and by accepting the legal penalty for their actions,
civil disobedients make manifest both the sincerity of their protest and their respect for the rule of law and the fundamental
principles of democracy.
So conceived, civil disobedience is not difficult to justify. The
justification does not have to be strong enough to override the
obligation to obey a democratic decision, since disobedience is
an attempt to restore, rather than frustrate, the process of democratic decision making. Disobedience of this kind could be
justified by, for instance, the aim of making the public aware
303 

of the loss of irreplaceable wilderness caused by the construction
of a dam, or of how animals are treated in the laboratories and
factory farms that few people ever see.
The use of illegal means to prevent action undeniably in accordance with the majority view is harder - but not impossible
- to justify. We may think it unlikely that a Nazi-style policy
of genocide could ever be approved by a majority vote, but if
that were to happen it would be carrying respect for majority
rule to absurd lengths to regard oneself as bound to accept the
majority decision. To oppose evils of that magnitude, we are
justified in using virtually any means likely to be effective.
Genocide is an extreme case. To grant that it justifies the use
of illegal means even against a majority concedes very little in
terms of practical political action. Yet admitting even one exception to the obligation to abide by democratic decisions raises
further questions: where is the line to be drawn between evils
like genocide, where the obligation is clearly overridden, and
less serious issues, where it is not? And who is to decide on
which side of this imaginary line a particular issue falls? Gary
Leber, of Operation Rescue, has written that in the United States
alone, since 1973, 'We've already destroyed four times the number of people that Hitler did.' Ronnie Lee, one of the British
founders of the Animal Liberation Front, has also used the Nazi
metaphor for what we do to animals, saying: 'Although we are
only one species among many on earth, we've set up a Reich
totally dominating the other animals, even enslaving them.' It
is not surprising then, that these activists consider their disobedience well justified. But do they have the right to take this
decision themselves? If not, who is to decide when an issue is
so serious that, even in a democracy, the obligation to obey the
law is overridden?
The only answer this question can have is: we must decide
for ourselves on which side of the line particular cases fall. There
is no other way of deciding, since the society's method of settling
304 

issues has already made its decision. The majority cannot be
judge in its own case. If we think the majority decision wrong,
we must make up our own minds about how gravely it is wrong.
This does not mean that any decision we make on such an
issue is subjective or arbitrary. In this book, I have offered arguments about a number of moral issues. If we apply these
arguments to the four cases with which this chapter began, they
lead to specific conclusions. The racist Nazi policy of murdering
Jews was obviously an atrocity, and Oskar Schindler was entirely right to do what he could to save some Jews from falling
victim to it. (Given the personal risks he ran, he was also morally
heroic to do so.) On the basis of the arguments put forward in
Chapter 3 of this book, the experiments that Gennarelli conducted on monkeys were wrong, because they treated sentient
creatures as mere things to be used as research tools. To stop
such experiments is a desirable goal, and if breaking in to Gennarelli's laboratory and stealing his videotapes was the only way
to achieve it, that seems to me justifiable. Similarly, for reasons
explored in Chapter 10, to drown the Franklin valley in order
to generate a relatively small amount of electricity could only
have been based on values that were unjustifiable both for taking a short-term perspective, and for being overly humancentred. Civil disobedience was an appropriate means of testifying to the importance of the values that had been overlooked
by those who favoured the dam.
At the same time, the arguments that lie behind Operation
Rescue's activities were found to be flawed when they were
examined in Chapter 6. The human fetus is not entitled to the
same sort of protection as older human beings, and so those
who think of abortion as morally equivalent to murder are
wrong. On this basis, Operation Rescue's campaign of civil disobedience against abortion is not justifiable. But it is important
to realise that the mistake lies in Operation Rescue's moral
reasoning about abortion, not in their moral reasoning about
305 

civil disobedience. If abortion really were morally equivalent to
murder, we all ought to be out there blocking the doors to the
abortion clinics.
This makes life difficult, of course. It is not likely that members
of Operation Rescue will be convinced by the arguments in this
book. Their reliance on biblical quotations does not augur well
for their openness to moral reasoning on non-religious grounds.
So there is no easy way of convincing them that their civil
disobedience is unjustified. We may regret this, but there is
nothing to be done about it. There is no simple moral rule that
will enable us to declare when disobedience is justifiable and
when it is not, without going into the rights and wrongs of the
target of the disobedience.
When we are convinced that we are trying to stop something
that really is a serious moral wrong, we still have other moral
questions to ask ourselves. We must balance the magnitude of
the evil we are trying to stop against the possibility that our
actions will lead to a drastic decline in respect for law and for
democracy. We must also take into account the likelihood that
our actions will fail in their objective and provoke a reaction
that will reduce the chances of success by other means. (As, for
instance, terrorist attacks on an oppressive regime provide the
government with an ideal excuse to lock up its more moderate
political opponents, or violent attacks on experimenters enable
the research establishment to brand all critics of animal experimentation as terrorists.)
One result of a consequentialist approach to this issue that
may at first seem odd is that the more deeply ingrained the habit
of obedience to democratic rule, the more easily disobedience
can be defended. There is no paradox here, however, merely
another instance of the homely truth that while young plants
need to be cosseted, well-established specimens can take
rougher treatment. Thus on a given issue disobedience might
be justifiable in Britain or the United States but not in Cambodia
306 

or Russia during the period when these countries seek to establish democratic systems of government.
These issues cannot be settled in general terms. Every case
differs. When the evils to be stopped are neither utterly horrendous (like genocide) nor relatively harmless (like the design
for a new national flag), reasonable people will differ on the
justifiability of attempting to thwart the implementation of a
considered decision democratically reached. Where illegal
means are used with this aim, an important step has been taken,
for disobedience then ceases to be 'civil disobedience', if by that
term is meant disobedience that is justified by an appeal to
principles that the community itself accepts as the proper way
of running its affairs. It may still be best for such obedience to
be civil in the other sense of the term, which makes a contrast
with the use of violence or the tactics of terrorism.
VIOLENCE
As we have seen, civil disobedience intended as a means of
attracting publicity or persuading the majority to reconsider is
much easier to justify than disobedience intended to coerce the
majority. Violence is obviously harder still to defend. Some go
so far as to say that the use of violence as a means, particularly
violence against people, is never justified, no matter how good
the end.
Opposition to the use of violence can be on the basis of an
absolute rule, or an assessment of its consequences. Pacifists
have usually regarded the use of violence as absolutely wrong,
irrespective of its consequences. This, like other 'no matter what'
prohibitions, assumes the validity of the distinction between
acts and omissions. Without this distinction, pacifists who refuse
to use violence when it is the only means of preventing greater
violence would be responsible for the greater violence they fail
to prevent.
307 

Suppose we have an opportunity to assassinate a tyrant who
is systematically murdering his opponents and anyone else he
dislikes. We know that if the tyrant dies he will be replaced by
a popular opposition leader, now in exile, who will restore the
rule of law. If we say that violence is always wrong, and refuse
to carry out the assassination, mustn't we bear some responsibility for the tyrant's future murders?
If the objections made to the acts and omissions distinction
in Chapter 7 were sound, those who do not use violence to
prevent greater violence have to take responsibility for the violence they could have prevented, Thus the rejection of the acts
and omissions distinction makes a crucial difference to the discussion of violence, for it opens the door to a plausible argument
in defence of violence.
Marxists have often used this argument to rebut attacks on
their doctrine of the need for violent revolution. In his classic
indictment of the social effects of nineteenth-century capitalism,
The Condition of the Working Class in England, Engels wrote:
If one individual inflicts a bodily injury upon another which
leads to the death of the person attacked we call it manslaughter;
on the other hand, if the attacker knows beforehand that the
blow will be fatal we call it murder. Murder has also been committed if society places hundreds of workers in such a position
that they inevitably come to premature and unnatural ends. Their
death is as violent as if they had been stabbed or shot Murder
has been committed if thousands of workers have been deprived
of the necessities of life or if they have been forced into a situation
in which it is impossible for them to survive Murder has been
committed if society knows perfectly well that thousands of
workers cannot avoid being sacrificed so long as these conditions
are allowed to continue. Murder of this sort is just as culpable
as the murder committed by an individual. At first sight it does
not appear to be murder at all because responsibility for the death
of the victim cannot be pinned on any individual assailant. Everyone is responsible and yet no one is responsible, because it appears as if the victim has died from natural causes. If a worker
dies no one places the responsibility for his death on society,
308 

though some would realize that society has failed to take steps
to prevent the victim from dying. But it is murder all the same.
One might object to Engels's use of the term 'murder'. The
objection would resemble the arguments discussed in Chapter
8, when we considered whether our failure to aid the starving
makes us murderers. We saw that there is no intrinsic significance in the distinction between acts and omissions; but from
the point of view of motivation and the appropriateness of
blame, most cases of failing to prevent death are not equivalent
to murder. The same would apply to the cases Engels describes.
Engels tries to pin the blame on 'society', but 'society' is not a
person or a moral agent, and cannot be held responsible in the
way an individual can.
Still, this is nit-picking. Whether or not 'murder' is the right
term, whether or not we are prepared to describe as 'violent'
the deaths of malnourished workers in unhealthy and unsafe
factories, Engels's fundamental point stands. These deaths are
a wrong of the same order of magnitude as the deaths of
hundreds of people in a terrorist bombing would be. It would
be one-sided to say that violent revolution is always absolutely
wrong, without taking account of the evils that the revolutionaries are trying to stop. If violent means had been the only way
of changing the conditions Engels describes, those who opposed
the use of violent means would have been responsible for the
continuation of those conditions.
Some of the practices we have been discussing in this book
are violent, either directly or by omission. In the case of nonhuman animals, our treatment is often violent by any description. Those who regard the human fetus as a moral subject will
obviously consider abortion to be a violent act against it. In the
case of humans at or after birth, what are we to say of an
avoidable situation in which some countries have infant mortality rates eight times higher than others, and a person born
in one country can expect to live twenty years more than someone born in another country? Is this violence? Again, it doesn't
309 

really matter whether we call it violence or not. In its effects it
is as terrible as violence.
Absolutist condemnations of violence stand or fall with the
distinction between acts and omissions. Therefore they fall.
There are, however, strong consequentialist objections to the
use of violence. We have been premising our discussion on the
assumption that violence might be the only means of changing
things for the better. Absolutists have no interest in challenging
this assumption because they reject violence whether the assumption is true or false. Consequentialists must ask whether
violence ever is the only means to an important end, or, if not
the only means, the swiftest means. They must also ask about
the long-term effects of pursuing change by violent means.
Could one defend, on consequentialist grounds, a condemnation of violence that is in practice, if not in principle, as allencompassing as that of the absolute pacifist? One might attempt to do so by emphasising the hardening effect that the use
of violence has, how committing one murder, no matter how
'necessary' or 'justified' it may seem, lessens the resistance to
committing further murders. Is it likely that people who have
become inured to acting violently will be able to create a better
society? This is a question on which the historical record is
relevant. The course taken by the Russian Revolution must
shake the belief that a burning desire for social justice provides
immunity to the corrupting effects of violence. There are, admittedly, other examples that may be read the other way; but
it would take a considerable number of examples to outweigh
the legacy of Lenin and Stalin.
The consequentialist pacifist can use another argument - the
argument I urged against the suggestion that we should allow
starvation to reduce the populations of the poorest nations to
the level at which they could feed themselves. Like this policy,
violence involves certain harm, said to be justified by the prospects of future benefits. But the future benefits can never be
certain, and even in the few cases where violence does bring
310 

about desirable ends, we can rarely be sure that the ends could
not have been achieved equally soon by non-violent means.
What, for instance, has been achieved by the thousands of
deaths and injuries caused by more than twenty years of the
Irish Republican Army bombings in Northern Ireland? Only
counter-terrorism by extremist Protestant groups. Or think of
the wasted death and suffering caused by the Baader-Meinhoff
gang in Germany, or the Red Brigade in Italy. What did the
Palestinian Liberation Organization gain from terrorism, other
than a less compromising, more ruthless Israel than the one
against which they began their struggle? One may sympathize
with the ends some of these groups are fighting for, but the
means they are using hold no promise of gaining their ends.
Using these means therefore indicates callous disregard of the
interests of their victims. These consequentialist arguments add
up to a strong case against the use of violence as a means,
particularly when the violence is indiscriminately directed
against ordinary members of the public, as terrorist violence
often is. In practical terms, that kind of violence would seem
never justified.
There are other kinds of violence that cannot be ruled out so
convincingly. There is, for instance, the assassination of a murderous tyrant. Here, provided the murderous policies are an
expression of the tyrant's personality rather than part of the
institutions he commands, the violence is strictly limited, the
aim is the end of much greater violence, success from a single
violent act may be highly probable, and there may be no other
way of ending the tyrant's rule. It would be implausible for a
consequentialist to maintain that committing violence in these
circumstances would have a corrupting effect, or that more,
rather than less, violence would result from the assassination.
Violence may be limited in a different way. The cases we have
been considering have involved violence against people. These
are the standard cases that come to mind when we discuss
violence, but there are other kinds of violence. Animal Liber311 

ation Front members have damaged laboratories, cages, and
equipment used to confine, hurt, or kill animals, but they avoid
violent acts against any animal, human or non-human. (Other
organizations claiming to be acting on behalf of animals have,
however, injured at least two people by explosive devices. These
actions have been condemned by every well-known animal
liberation organization, including the Animal Liberation Front.)
Earth First!, a radical American environmentalist organization,
advocates 'monkeywrenching' or 'ecotage' - secret acts designed to stop or slow down processes that are harmful to the
environment. Dave Foreman and Bill Haywood of Earth First!
have co-edited Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching, a
book that describes techniques for disabling computers, wrecking machinery, and blocking sewerage systems. In their view:
Monkeywrenching is a non-violent resistance to the destruction
of natural diversity and wilderness. It is not aimed toward harming human beings or other forms of life. |t is aimed at inanimate
machines and tools Monkeywrenchers are very conscious of
the gravity of what they do. They are deliberate about taking
such a serious step They remember that they are engaged in
the most moral of all actions: protecting life, defending the Earth.
A more controversial technique is 'spiking' trees in forests that
are to be logged. Putting metal spikes in a few trees in a forest
makes it dangerous to saw timber from the forest, because the
workers at the sawmill can never know when the saw might
hit a spike, breaking the saw and sending sharp pieces of metal
flying around the working area. Ecological activists who support
spiking say that they warn the timber companies that trees in
a certain area have been spiked, and if they go ahead and log
the forests, any injuries that occur are the responsibility of the
timber company managers who made that decision. But it is
the workers who will be hurt, not the managers. Can the activists really shed their responsibility in this way? More orthodox environmental activists reject such tactics.
Damage to property is not as serious a matter as injuring or
312 

killing; hence it may be justified on grounds that would not
justify anything that caused harm to sentient beings. This does
not mean that violence to property is of no significance. Property
means a great deal to some people, and one would need to
have strong reasons to justify destroying it. But such reasons
may exist. The justification might not be anything so epochmaking as transforming society. As in the case of the raid on
Gennarelli's laboratory, it might be the specific and short-term
goal of saving a number of animals from a painful experiment,
performed on animals only because of society's speciesist bias.
Again, whether such an action would really be justifiable from
a consequentialist point of view would depend on the details
of the actual situation. Someone lacking expertise could easily
be mistaken about the value of an experiment or the degree of
suffering it involved. And will not the result of damaging equipment and liberating one lot of animals simply be that more
equipment is bought and more animals are bred? What is to be
done with the liberated animals? Will illegal acts mean that the
government will resist moves to reform the law relating to animal experiments, arguing that it must not appear to be yielding
to violence? All these questions would need to be answered
satisfactorily before one could come to a decision in favour of,
say, damaging a laboratory. A related set of questions must also
be answered before one can justify damaging a bulldozer that
is being used to clear an old-growth forest.
Violence is not easy to justify, even if it is violence against
property rather than against sentient beings, or violence against
a dictator rather than indiscriminate violence against the general
public. Nevertheless, the differences between kinds of violence
are important, because only by observing them can we condemn
one kind of violence - the terrorist kind - in virtually absolute
terms. The differences are blurred by sweeping condemnations
of everything that falls under the general heading 'violence'.

WHY ACT MORALLY?
P
REVIOUS chapters of this book have discussed what we
ought, morally, to do about several practical issues and what
means we are justified in adopting to achieve our ethical goals.
The nature of our conclusions about these issues - the demands
they make upon us - raises a further, more fundamental question: why should we act morally?
Take our conclusions about the use of animals for food, or
the aid the rich should give the poor. Some readers may accept
these conclusions, become vegetarians, and do what they can
to reduce absolute poverty. Others may disagree with our conclusions, maintaining that there is nothing wrong with eating
animals and that they are under no moral obligation to do
anything about reducing absolute poverty. There is also, however, likely to be a third group, consisting of readers who find
no fault with the ethical arguments of these chapters, yet do
not change their diets or their contributions to overseas aid. Of
this third group, some will just be weak-willed, but others may
want an answer to a further practical question. If the conclusions
of ethics require so much of us, they may ask, should we bother
about ethics at all?
UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION
'Why should I act morally?' is a different type of question from
those that we have been discussing up to now. Questions like
'Why should I treat people of different ethnic groups equally?'
or 'Why is abortion justifiable?' seek ethical reasons for acting
314 
?
in a certain way. These are questions within ethics. They presuppose the ethical point of view. 'Why should I act morally?'
is on another level. It is not a question within ethics, but a
question about ethics.
'Why should I act morally?' is therefore a question aboutsomething normally presupposed. Such questions are perplexing. Some philosophers have found this particular question so
perplexing that they have rejected it as logically improper, as
an attempt to ask something that cannot properly be asked.
One ground for this rejection is the claim that our ethical
principles are, by definition, the principles we take as overridingly important. This means that whatever principles are
overriding for a particular person are necessarily that person's
ethical principles, and a person who accepts as an ethical principle that she ought to give her wealth to help the poor must,
by definition, have actually decided to give away her wealth.
On this definition of ethics once a person has made an ethical
decision no further practical question can arise. Hence it is impossible to make sense of the question: 'Why should I act
morally?'
It might be thought a good reason for accepting the definition
of ethics as overriding that it allows us to dismiss as meaningless
an otherwise troublesome question. Adopting this definition
cannot solve real problems, however, for it leads to correspondingly greater difficulties in establishing any ethical conclusion.
Take, for example, the conclusion that the rich ought to aid the
poor. We were able to argue for this in Chapter 8 only because
we assumed that, as suggested in the first two chapters of this
book, the universalisability of ethical judgments requires us to
go beyond thinking only about our own interests, and leads us
to take a point of view from which we must give equal consideration to the interests of all affected by our actions. We cannot
hold that ethical judgments must be universalisable and at the
same time define a person's ethical principles as whatever principles that person takes as overridingly important - for what if
315 

I take as overridingly important some non-universalisable principle like 'I ought to do whatever benefits me"? If we define
ethical principles as whatever principles one takes as overriding,
then anything whatever may count as an ethical principle, for
one may take any principle whatever as overridingly important.
Thus what we gain by being able to dismiss the question:'Why
should I act morally?' we lose by being unable to use the universalisability of ethical judgments - or any other feature of
ethics - to argue for particular conclusions about what is morally
right. Taking ethics as in some sense necessarily involving a
universal point of view seems to me a more natural and less
confusing way of discussing these issues.
Other philosophers have rejected 'Why should I act morally?'
for a different reason. They think it must be rejected for the
same reason that we must reject another question, 'Why should
I be rational?' which like 'Why should I act morally?' also
questions something - in this case rationality - normally presupposed. 'Why should I be rational?' really is logically improper because in answering it we would be giving reasons for
being rational. Thus we would presuppose rationality in our
attempt to justify rationality. The resulting justification of rationality would be circular - which shows, not that rationality
lacks a necessary justification, but that it needs no justification,
because it cannot intelligibly be questioned unless it is already
presupposed.
Is 'Why should I act morally?' like 'Why should I be rational?'
in that it presupposes the very point of view it questions? It
would be, if we interpreted the 'should' as a moral 'should'.
Then the question would ask for moral reasons for being moral.
This would be absurd. Once we have decided that an action is
morally obligatory, there is no further moral question to ask. It
is redundant to ask why I should, morally, do the action that I
morally should do.
There is, however, no need to interpret the question as a
request for an ethical justification of ethics. 'Should' need not
316 
?
mean 'should, morally'. It could simply be a way of asking for
reasons for action, without any specification about the kind of
reasons wanted. We sometimes want to ask a general practical
question, from no particular point of view. Faced with a difficult
choice, we ask a close friend for advice. Morally, he says, we
ought to do A, but B would be more in our interests, while
etiquette demands C and only D would display a real sense of
style. This answer may not satisfy us. We want advice on which
of these standpoints to adopt. If it is possible to ask such a
question we must ask it from a position of neutrality between
all these points of view, not of commitment to any one of them.
'Why should I act morally?' is this sort of question. If it is
not possible to ask practical questions without presupposing a
point of view, we are unable to say anything intelligible about
the most ultimate practical choices. Whether to act according
to considerations of ethics, self-interest, etiquette, or aesthetics
would be a choice 'beyond reason' - in a sense, an arbitrary
choice. Before we resign ourselves to this conclusion we should
at least attempt to interpret the question so that the mere asking
of it does not commit us to any particular point of view.
We can now formulate the question more precisely. It is a
question about the ethical point of view, asked from a position
outside it. But what is 'the ethical point of view'? I have suggested that a distinguishing feature of ethics is that ethical judgments are universalisable. Ethics requires us to go beyond our
own personal point of view to a standpoint like that of the
impartial spectator who takes a universal point of view.
Given this conception of ethics, 'Why should I act morally?'
is a question that may properly be asked by anyone wondering
whether to act only on grounds that would be acceptable from
this universal point of view. It is, after all, possible to act - and
some people do act - without thinking of anything except one's
own interests. The question asks for reasons for going beyond
this personal basis of action and acting only on judgments one
is prepared to prescribe universally.
317 

REASON AND ETHICS
There is an ancient line of philosophical thought that attempts
to demonstrate that to act rationally is to act ethically. The
argument is today associated with Kant and is mainly found in
the writings of modern Kantians, though it goes back as least
as far as the Stoics. The form in which the argument is presented
varies, but the common structure is as follows:
1 Some requirement of universalisability or impartiality is essential to ethics.
2 Reason is universally or objectively valid. If, for example, itfollows from the premises 'All humans are mortal' and 'Socrates is human' that Socrates is mortal, then this inference
must follow universally. It cannot be valid for me and invalid
for you. This is a general point about reason, whether theoretical or practical.
Therefore:
3 Only a judgment that satisfies the requirement described in
(1) as a necessary condition of an ethical judgment will be an
objectively rational judgment in accordance with (2). For I
cannot expect any other rational agents to accept as valid for
them a judgment that I would not accept if I were in their
place; and if two rational agents could not accept each other's
judgments, they could not be rational judgments, for the reason given in (2). To say that I would accept the judgment I
make, even if I were in someone else's position and they in
mine is, however, simply to say that my judgment is one I
can prescribe from a universal point of view. Ethics and reason
both require us to rise above our own particular point of view
and take a perspective from which our own personal identity
- the role we happen to occupy - is unimportant. Thus reason
requires us to act on universalisable judgments and, to that
extent, to act ethically.
Is this argument valid? I have already indicated that I accept
the first point, that ethics involves universalisability. The second
318 
?
point also seems undeniable. Reason must be universal. Does
the conclusion therefore follow? Here is the flaw in the argument. The conclusion appears to follow directly from the premises; but this move involves a slide from the limited sense in
which it is true that a rational judgment must be universally
valid, to a stronger sense of 'universally valid' that is equivalent
to universalisability. The difference between these two senses
can be seen by considering a non-universalisable imperative,
like the purely egoistic: 'Let everyone do what is in my interests.'
This differs from the imperative of universalisable egoism - 'Let
everyone do what is in her or his own interests' - because it
contains an ineliminable reference to a particular person. It
therefore cannot be an ethical imperative. Does it also lack the
universality required if it is to be a rational basis for action?
Surely not. Every rational agent could accept that the purely
egoistic activity of other rational agents is rationally justifiable.
Pure egoism could be rationally adopted by everyone.
Let us look at this more closely. It must be conceded that
there is a sense in which one purely egoistic rational agent -
call him Jack - could not accept the practical judgments of
another purely egoistic rational agent - call her Jill. Assuming
Jill's interests differ from Jack's, Jill may be acting rationally in
urging Jack to do A, while Jack is also acting rationally in
deciding against doing A.
This disagreement is, however, compatible with all rational
agents accepting pure egoism. Though they accept pure egoism,
it points them in different directions because they start from
different places. When Jack adopts pure egoism, it leads him to
further his interests and when Jill adopts pure egoism it leads
her to further her interests. Hence the disagreement over what
to do. On the other hand - and this is the sense in which pure
egoism could be accepted as valid by all rational agents - if we
were to ask Jill (off the record and promising not to tell Jack)
what she thinks it would be rational for Jack to do, she would.
319 

if truthful, have to reply that it would be rational for Jack to
do what is in his own interests, rather than what is in her
interests.
So when purely egoistic rational agents oppose each other's
acts, it does not indicate disagreement over the rationality of
pure egoism. Pure egoism, though not a universalisable principle, could be accepted as a rational basis of action by all rational agents. The sense in which rational judgments must be
universally acceptable is weaker than the sense in which ethical
judgements must be. That an action will benefit me rather than
anyone else could be a valid reason for doing it, though it could
not be an ethical reason for doing it.
A consequence of this conclusion is that rational agents may
rationally try to prevent each other from doing what they admit
the other is rationally justified in doing. There is, unfortunately,
nothing paradoxical about this. Two salespeople competing for
an important sale will accept each other's conduct as rational,
though each aims to thwart the other. The same holds of two
soldiers meeting in battle, or two footballers vying for the ball.
Accordingly, this attempted demonstration of a link between
reason and ethics fails. There may be other ways of forging this
link, but it is difficult to see any that hold greater promise of
success. The chief obstacle to be overcome is the nature of practical reason. Long ago David Hume argued that reason in action
applies only to means, not to ends. The ends must be given by
our wants and desires. Hume unflinchingly drew out the implications of this view:
'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole
world to the scratching of my finger. Tis not contrary to reason
for me to choose my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness
of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me. 'Tis as little
contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledged lesser
good to my greater, and have a more ardent affection for the
former than the latter.
320 
?
Extreme as it is, Hume's view of practical reason has stood up
to criticism remarkably well. His central claim - that in practical
reasoning we start from something wanted - is difficult to refute;
yet it must be refuted if any argument is to succeed in showing
that it is rational for all of us to act ethically irrespective of what
we want.
Nor is the refutation of Hume all that is needed for a demonstration of the rational necessity of acting ethically. In The
Possibility of Altruism, Thomas Nagel has argued forcefully that
not to take one's own future desires into account in one's practical deliberations - irrespective of whether one now happens
to desire the satisfaction of those future desires - would indicate
a failure to see oneself as a person existing over time, the present
being merely one time among others in one's life. So it is my
conception of myself as a person that makes it rational for me
to consider my long-term interests. This holds true even if I have
'a more ardent affection' for something that I acknowledge is
not really, all things considered, in my own interest.
Whether Nagel's argument succeeds in vindicating the rationality of prudence is one question: whether a similar argument can also be used in favour of a form of altruism based on
taking the desires of others into account is another question
altogether. Nagel attempts this analogous argument. The role
occupied by 'seeing the present as merely one time among others' is, in the argument for altruism, taken by 'seeing oneself as
merely one person among others'. But whereas it would be
extremely difficult for most of us to cease conceiving of ourselves
as existing over time, with the present merely one time among
others that we will live through, the way we see ourselves as
a person among others is quite different. Henry Sidgwick's observation on this point seems to me exactly right:
It would be contrary to Common Sense to deny that the distinction between any one individual and any other is real and
fundamental, and that consequently 'I' am concerned with the
321 

quality of my existence as an individual in a sense, fundamentally
important, in which I am not concerned with the quality of the
existence of other individuals: and this being so, I do not see
how it can be proved that this distinction is not to be taken as
fundamental in determining the ultimate end of rational action
for an individual.
So it is not only Hume's view of practical reason that stands in
the way of attempts to show that to act rationally is to act
ethically; we might succeed in overthrowing that barrier, only
to find our way blocked by the commonsense distinction between self and others. Taken together, these are formidable
obstacles and I know of no way of overcoming them.
ETHICS AND SELF-INTEREST
If practical reasoning begins with something wanted, to show
that it is rational to act morally would involve showing that in
acting morally we achieve something we want. If, agreeing with
Sidgwick rather than Hume, we hold that it is rational to act
in our long-term interests irrespective of what we happen to
want at the present moment, we could show that it is rational
to act morally by showing that it is in our long-term interests
to do so. There have been many attempts to argue along these
lines, ever since Plato, in The Republic, portrayed Socrates as
arguing that to be virtuous is to have the different elements of
one's personality ordered in a harmonious manner, and this is
necessary for happiness. We shall look at these arguments
shortly; but first it is necessary to assess an objection to this
whole approach to 'Why should I act morally?'
People often say that to defend morality by appealing to selfinterest is to misunderstand what ethics is all about. F. H. Bradley stated this eloquently:
What answer can we give when the question Why should I be
Moral?, in the sense of What will it advantage Me?, is put to
us? Here we shall do well, I think, to avoid all praises of the
322 
?
pleasantness of virtue. We may believe that it transcends all
possible delights of vice, but it would be well to remember that
we desert a moral point of view, that we degrade and prostitute
virtue, when to those who do not love her for herself we bring
ourselves to recommend her for the sake of her pleasures.
In other words, we can never get people to act morally by
providing reasons of self-interest, because if they accept what
we say and act on the reasons given, they will only be acting
self-interestedly, not morally.
One reply to this objection would be that the substance of
the action, what is actually done, is more important than the
motive. People might give money to famine relief because their
friends will think better of them, or they might give the same
amount because they think it their duty. Those saved from starvation by the gift will benefit to the same extent either way.
This is true but crude. It can be made more sophisticated if
it is combined with an appropriate account of the nature and
* function of ethics. Ethics, though not consciously created, is a
product of social life that has the function of promoting values
common to the members of the society. Ethical judgments do
this by praising and encouraging actions in accordance with
these values. Ethical judgments are concerned with motives
because this is a good indication of the tendency of an action
to promote good or evil, but also because it is here that praise
and blame may be effective in altering the tendency of a person's
actions. Conscientiousness (that is, acting for the sake of doing
what is right) is a particularly useful motive, from the community's point of view. People who are conscientious will, if
they accept the values of their society (and if most people did
not accept these values they would not be the values of the
society) always tend to promote what the society values. They
may have no generous or sympathetic inclinations, but if they
think it their duty to give famine relief, they will do so. Moreover, those motivated by the desire to do what is right can be
relied upon to act as they think right in all circumstances,
323 

whereas those who act from some other motive, like selfinterest, will only do what they think right when they believe
it will also be in their interest. Conscientiousness is thus a kind
of multipurpose gap-filler that can be used to motivate people
towards whatever is valued, even if the natural virtues normally
associated with action in accordance with those values (generosity, sympathy, honesty, tolerance, humility, and so on) are
lacking. (This needs some qualification: a conscientious mother
may provide as well for her children as a mother who loves
them, but she cannot love them because it is the right thing to
do. Sometimes conscientiousness is a poor substitute for the real
thing.)
On this view of ethics it is still results, not motives, that really
matter. Conscientiousness is of value because of its consequences. Yet, unlike, say, benevolence, conscientiousness can
be praised and encouraged only for its own sake. To praise a
conscientious act for its consequences would be to praise not
conscientiousness, but something else altogether. If we appeal
to sympathy or self-interest as a reason for doing one's duty,
then we are not encouraging people to do their duty for its own
sake. If conscientiousness is to be encouraged, it must be thought
of as good for its own sake.
It is different in the case of an act done from a motive that
people act upon irrespective of praise and encouragement. The
use of ethical language is then inappropriate. We do not normally say that people ought to do, or that it is their duty to do,
whatever gives them the greatest pleasure, for most people are
sufficiently motivated to do this anyway. So, whereas we praise
good acts done for the sake of doing what is right, we withhold
our praise when we believe the act was done from some motive
like self-interest.
This emphasis on motives and on the moral worth of doing
right for its own sake is now embedded in our notion of ethics.
To the extent that it is so embedded, we will feel that to provide
324 
?
considerations of self-interest for doing what is right is to empty
the action of its moral worth.
My suggestion is that our notion of ethics has -become misleading to the extent that moral worth is attributed only to action
done because it is right, without any ulterior motive. It is understandable, and from the point of view of society perhaps
even desirable, that this attitude should prevail; nevertheless,
those who accept this view of ethics, and are led by it to do
what is right because it is right, without asking for any further
reason, are falling victim to a kind of confidence trick - though
not, of course, a consciously perpetrated one.
That this view of ethics is unjustifiable has already been indicated by the failure of the argument discussed earlier in this
chapter for a rational justification of ethics. In the history of
Western philosophy, no one has urged more strongly than Kant
that our ordinary moral consciousness finds moral worth only
when duty is done for duty's sake. Yet Kant himself saw that
without a rational justification this common conception of ethics
would be 'a mere phantom of the brain'. And this is indeed the
case. If we reject - as in general terms we have done - the
Kantian justification of the rationality of ethics, but try to retain
the Kantian conception of ethics, ethics is left hanging without
support. It becomes a closed system, a system that cannot be
questioned because its first premise - that only action done
because it is right has any moral worth - rules out the only
remaining possible justification for accepting this very premise.
Morality is, on this view, no more rational an end than any
other allegedly self-justifying practice, like etiquette or the kind
of religious faith that comes only to those who first set aside all
sceptical doubts.
Taken as a view of ethics as a whole, we should abandon this
Kantian notion of ethics. This does not mean, however, that
we should never do what we see to be right simply because we
see it to be right, without further reasons. Here we need to
325 

appeal to the distinction Hare has made between intuitive and
critical thinking. When I stand back from my day-to-day ethical
decisions and ask why I should act ethically, I should seek
reasons in the broadest sense, and not allow Kantian preconceptions to deter me from considering self-interested reasons
for living an ethical life. If my search is successful it will provide
me with reasons for taking up the ethical point of view as a
settled policy, a way of living. I would not then ask, in my dayto-day ethical decision making, whether each particular right
action is in my interests. Instead I do it because I see myself as
an ethical person. In everyday situations, I will simply assume
that doing what is right is in my interests, and once I have
decided what is right, I will go ahead and do it, without thinking
about further reasons for doing what is right. To deliberate over
the ultimate reasons for doing what is right in each case would
impossibly complicate my life; it would also be inadvisable because in particular situations I might be too greatly influenced
by strong but temporary desires and inclinations and so make
decisions I would later regret.
That, at least, is how a justification of ethics in terms of selfinterest might work, without defeating its own aim. We can
now ask if such a justification exists. There is a daunting list of
those who, following Plato's lead, have offered one: Aristotle,
Aquinas, Spinoza, Butler, Hegel, even - for all his strictures
against prostituting virtue - Bradley. Like Plato, these philosophers made broad claims about human nature and the conditions under which human beings can be happy. Some were
also able to fall back on a belief that virtue will be rewarded
and wickedness punished in a life after our bodily death. Philosophers cannot use this argument if they want to carry conviction nowadays; nor can they adopt sweeping psychological
theories on the basis of their own general experience of their
fellows, as philosophers used to do when psychology was a
branch of philosophy.
It might be said that since philosophers are not empirical
326 
?
scientists, discussion of the connection between acting ethically
and living a fulfilled and happy life should be left to psychologists, sociologists, and other appropriate experts. The question
is not, however, dealt with by any other single discipline and
its relevance to practical ethics is reason enough for our looking
into it.
What facts about human nature could show that ethics and
self- interest coincide? One theory is that we all have benevolent
or sympathetic inclinations that make us concerned about the
welfare of others. Another relies on a natural conscience that
gives rise to guilt feelings when we do what we know to be
wrong. But how strong are these benevolent desires or feelings
of guilt? Is it possible to suppress them? If so, isn't it possible
that in a world in which humans and other animals are suffering
in great numbers, suppressing one's conscience and sympathy
for others is the surest way to happiness?
To meet this objection those who would link ethics and happiness must assert that we cannot be happy if these elements
of our nature are suppressed. Benevolence and sympathy, they
might argue, are tied up with the capacity to take part in friendly
or loving relations with others, and there can be no real happiness without such relationships. For the same reason it is
necessary to take at least some ethical standards seriously, and
to be open and honest in living by them - for a life of deception
and dishonesty is a furtive life, in which the possibility of discovery always clouds the horizon. Genuine acceptance of ethical
standards is likely to mean that we feel some guilt - or at least
that we are less pleased with ourselves than we otherwise would
be — when we do not live up to them.
These claims about the connection between our character and
our prospects of happiness are no more than hypotheses. Attempts to confirm them by detailed research are sparse and
inadequate. A. H. Maslow, an American psychologist, asserted
that human beings have a need for self-actualisation that involves growing towards courage, kindness, knowledge, love,
327 

honesty, and unselfishness. When we fulfil this need, we feel
serene, joyful, filled with zest, sometimes euphoric, and generally happy. When we act contrary to our need for selfactualisation, we experience anxiety, despair, boredom, shame,
emptiness and are generally unable to enjoy ourselves. It would
be nice if Maslow should turn out to be right; unfortunately,
the data Maslow produced in support of his theory consisted of
limited studies of selected people and cannot be considered
anything more than suggestive.
Human nature is so diverse that one may doubt if any generalisation about the kind of character that leads to happiness
could hold for all human beings. What, for instance, of those
we call 'psychopaths'? Psychiatrists use this term as a label for
a person who is asocial, impulsive, egocentric, unemotional,
lacking in feelings of remorse, shame, or guilt, and apparently
unable to form deep and enduring personal relationships. Psychopaths are certainly abnormal, but whether it is proper to say
that they are mentally ill is another matter. At least on the
surface, they do not suffer from their condition, and it is not
obvious that it is in their interest to be 'cured'. Hervey Cleckley,
the author of a classic study of psychopathy entitled The Mask
of Sanity, notes that since his book was first published he has
received countless letters from people desperate for help - but
they are from the parents, spouses, and other relatives of psychopaths, almost never from the psychopaths themselves. This
is not surprising, for while psychopaths are asocial and indifferent to the welfare of others, they seem to enjoy life. Psychopaths often appear to be charming, intelligent people, with no
delusions or other signs of irrational thinking. When interviewed they say things like: 'A lot has happened to me, a lot
more will happen. But I enjoy living and I am always looking
forward to each day. I like laughing and I've done a lot. I am
essentially a clown at heart - but a happy one. I always take
the bad with the good.' There is no effective therapy for psychopathy, which may be explained by the fact that psychopaths
328 
?
see nothing wrong with their behaviour and often find it extremely rewarding, at least in the short term. Of course their
impulsive nature and lack of a sense of shame or guilt means
that some psychopaths end up in prison, though it is hard to
tell how many do not, since those who avoid prison are also
more likely to avoid contact with psychiatrists. Studies have
shown that a surprisingly large number of psychopaths are able
to avoid prison despite grossly antisocial behaviour, probably
because of their well-known ability to convince others that they
are truly repentant, that it will never happen again, that they
deserve another chance, and so forth.
The existence of psychopathic people counts against the contention that benevolence, sympathy, and feelings of guilt are
present in everyone. It also appears to count against attempts
to link happiness with the possession of these inclinations. But
let us pause before we accept this latter conclusion. Must we
accept psychopaths' own evaluations of their happiness? They
are, after all, notoriously persuasive liars. Moreover, even if they
are telling the truth as they see it, are they qualified to say that
they are really happy, when they seem unable to experience
the emdtional states that play such a large part in the happiness
and fulfilment of more normal people? Admittedly, a psychopath could use the same argument against us: how can we say
that we are truly happy when we have not experienced the
excitement and freedom that comes from complete irresponsibility? Since we cannot enter into the subjective states of psychopathic people, nor they into ours, the dispute is not easy to
resolve.
Cleckley suggests that the psychopaths' behaviour can be explained as a response to the meaninglessness of their lives. It is
characteristic of psychopaths to work for a while at a job and
then just when their ability and charm have taken them to the
crest of success, commit some petty and easily detectable crime.
A similar pattern occurs in their personal relationships. (There
is support to be found here for Thomas Nagel's account of im329 

prudence as rational only if one fails to see oneself as a person
existing over time, with the present merely one among other
times one will live through. Certainly psychopathic people live
largely in the present and lack any coherent life plan.)
Cleckley explains this erratic and to us inadequately motivated behaviour by likening the psychopath's life to that of
children forced to sit through a performance of King Lear. Children are restless and misbehave under these conditions because
they cannot enjoy the play as adults do. They act to relieve
boredom. Similarly, Cleckley says, psychopaths are bored because their emotional poverty means that they cannot take interest in, or gain satisfaction from, what for others are the most
important things in life: love, family, success in business or
professional life, and the like. These things simply do not matter
to them. Their unpredictable and antisocial behaviour is an
attempt to relieve what would otherwise be a tedious existence.
These claims are speculative and Cleckley admits that they may
not be possible to establish scientifically. They do suggest, however, an aspect of the psychopath's life that undermines the
otherwise attractive nature of the psychopath's free-wheeling
life. Most reflective people, at some time or other, want their
life to have some kind of meaning. Few of us could deliberately
choose a way of life that we regarded as utterly meaningless.
For this reason most of us would not choose to live a psychopathic life, however enjoyable it might be.
Yet there is something paradoxical about criticising the psychopath's life for its meaninglessness. Don't we have to accept,
in the absence of religious belief, that life really is meaningless,
not just for the psychopath but for all of us? And if this is so,
why should we not choose - if it were in our power to choose
our personality - the life of a psychopath? But is it true that,
religion aside, life is meaningless? Now our pursuit of reasons
for acting morally has led us to what is often regarded as the
ultimate philosophical question.
330 
?
HAS LIFE A MEANING?
In what sense does rejection of belief in a god imply rejection
of the view that life has any meaning? If this world had been
created by some divine being with a particular goal in mind, it
could be said to have a meaning, at least for that divine being.
If we could know what the divine being's purpose in creating
us was, we could then know what the meaning of our life was
for our creator. If we accepted our creator's purpose (though
why we should do that would need to be explained) we could
claim to know the meaning of life.
When we reject belief in a god we must give up the idea that
life on this planet has some preordained meaning. Life as a whole
has no meaning. Life began, as the best available theories tell
us, in a chance combination of molecules; it then evolved
through random mutations and natural selection. All this just
happened; it did not happen for any overall purpose. Now that
it has resulted in the existence of beings who prefer some states
of affairs to others, however, it may be possible for particular
lives to be meaningful. In this sense atheists can find meaning
in life.
Let us return to the comparison between the life of a psychopath and that of a more normal person. Why should the
psychopath's life not be meaningful? We have seen that psychopaths are egocentric to an extreme: neither other people,
nor worldly success, nor anything else really matters to them.
But why is their own enjoyment of life not sufficient to give
meaning to their lives?
Most of us would not be able to find happiness by deliberately
setting out to enjoy ourselves without caring about anyone or
anything else. The pleasures we obtained in that way would
seem empty and would soon pall. We seek a meaning for our
lives beyond our own pleasures and find fulfilment and happiness in doing what we see to be meaningful. If our life has
331 

no meaning other than our own happiness, we are likely to find
that when we have obtained what we think we need to be
happy, happiness itself still eludes us.
That those who aim at happiness for happiness's sake often
fail to find it, while others find happiness in pursuing altogether
different goals, has been called 'the paradox of hedonism'. It is
not, of course, a logical paradox but a claim about the way in
which we come to be happy. Like other generalisations on this
subject, it lacks empirical confirmation. Yet it matches our everyday observations and is consistent with our nature as evolved,
purposive beings. Human beings survive and reproduce themselves through purposive action. We obtain happiness and fulfilment by working towards and achieving our goals. In
evolutionary terms we could say that happiness functions as an
internal reward for our achievements. Subjectively, we regard
achieving the goal (or progressing towards it) as a reason for
happiness. Our own happiness, therefore, is a by-product of
aiming at something else, and not to be obtained by setting our
sights on happiness alone.
The psychopath's life can now be seen to be meaningless in
a way that a normal life is not. It is meaningless because it looks
inward to the pleasures of the present moment and not outward
to anything more long-term or far-reaching. More normal lives
have meaning because they are lived to some larger purpose.
All this is speculative. You may accept or reject it to the extent
that it agrees with your own observation and introspection. My
next - and final - suggestion is more speculative still. It is that
to find an enduring meaning in our lives it is not enough to go
beyond psychopaths who have no long-term commitments or
life plans; we must also go beyond more prudent egoists who
have long term plans concerned only with their own interests.
The prudent egoists may find meaning in their lives for a time,
for they have the purpose of furthering their own interests; but
what, in the end, does that amount to? When everything in
our interests has been achieved, do we just sit back and be
332 
?
happy? Could we be happy in this way? Or would we decide
that we had still not quite reached our target, that there was
something else we needed before we could sit back and enjoy
it all? Most materially successful egoists take the latter route,
thus escaping the necessity of admitting that they cannot find
happiness in permanent holidaying. People who slaved to establish small businesses, telling themselves they would do it
only until they had made enough to live comfortably, keep
working long after they have passed their original target. Their
material 'needs' expand just fast enough to keep ahead of their
income.
The 1980s, the 'decade of greed', provided plenty of examples
of the insatiable nature of the desire for wealth. In 1985 Dennis
Levine was a highly successful Wall Street banker with the
fastest-growing and most talked-about Wall Street firm, Drexel
Bumham Lambert. But Levine was not satisfied:
When I was earning $20,000 a year, I thought, I can make
$100,000. When I was earning $100,000 a year, I thought, I can
make $200,000. When I was making $1 million, I thought, I can
make $3 million. There was always somebody one rung higher
on the ladder, and I could never stop wondering: Is he really
twice as good as I am.
Levine decided to take matters into his own hands and arranged
with friends at other Wall Street firms to exchange confidential
information that would allow them to profit by buying shares
in companies that were about to become takeover targets. By
this method Levine made an additional $11 million, on top of
what he earned in salary and bonuses. He also ended up bringing
about his own ruin, and spending time in prison. That, however,
is not the relevant point here. No doubt some who use inside
information to make millions of dollars do not get caught. What
is less certain, however, is that they really find satisfaction and
fulfilment in having more money.
Now we begin to see where ethics comes into the problem
of living a meaningful life. If we are looking for a purpose
333 

broader than our own interests, something that will allow us
to see our lives as possessing significance beyond the narrow
confines of our own conscious states, one obvious solution is
to take up the ethical point of view. The ethical point of view
does, as we have seen, require us to go beyond a personal point
of view to the standpoint of an impartial spectator. Thus looking
at things ethically is a way of transcending our inward-looking
concerns and identifying ourselves with the most objective point
of view possible - with, as Sidgwick put it, 'the point of view
of the universe'.
The point of view of the universe is a lofty standpoint. In the
rarefied air that surrounds it we may get carried away into
talking, as Kant does, of the moral point of view, 'inevitably'
humbling all who compare their own limited nature with it. I
do not want to suggest anything as sweeping as this. Earlier in
this chapter, in rejecting Thomas Nagel's argument for the rationality of altruism, I said that there is nothing irrational about
being concerned with the quality of one's own existence in a
way that one is not concerned with the quality of existence of
other individuals. Without going back on this, I am now suggesting that rationality, in the broad sense that includes selfawareness and reflection on the nature and point of our own
existence, may push us towards concerns broader than the quality of our own existence; but the process is not a necessary one
and those who do not take part in it - or, who in taking part,
do not follow it all the way to the ethical point of view - are
neither irrational nor in error. Psychopaths, for all I know, may
simply be unable to obtain as much happiness through caring
about others as they obtain by antisocial acts. Other people find
collecting stamps an entirely adequate way of giving purpose
to their lives. There is nothing irrational about that; but others
again grow out of stamp collecting as they become more aware
of their situation in the world and more reflective about their
purposes. To this third group the ethical point of view offers a
meaning and purpose in life that one does not grow out of.
334 
?
(At least, one cannot grow out of the ethical point of view
until all ethical tasks have been accomplished. If that Utopia
were ever achieved, our purposive nature might well leave us
dissatisfied, much as egoists might be dissatisfied when they
have everything they need to be happy. There is nothing paradoxical about this, for we should not expect evolution to have
equipped us, in advance, with the ability to enjoy a situation
that has never previously occurred. Nor is this going to be a
practical problem in the near future.)
'Why act morally?' cannot be given an answer that will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally.
Ethically indefensible behaviour is not always irrational. We
will probably always need the sanctions of the law and social
pressure to provide additional reasons against serious violations
