 ## FIRST BOOK: MEDITATIONS
 
 Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to
refrain from all anger and passion. From the fame and memory of him that
begot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour. Of my
mother I have learned to be religious, and bountiful; and to forbear,
not only to do, but to intend any evil; to content myself with a spare
diet, and to fly all such excess as is incidental to great wealth. Of my
great-grandfather, both to frequent public schools and auditories, and
to get me good and able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think
much, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges.

 Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of
the two great factions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini,
and Veneti: nor in the amphitheatre partially to favour any of the
gladiators, or fencers, as either the Parmularii, or the Secutores.
Moreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have
anything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle
with many businesses; and not easily to admit of any slander.

 Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily
to believe those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon
them to work wonders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and
impostors; concerning the power of charms, and their driving out of
demons, or evil spirits; and the like. Not to keep quails for the game;
nor to be mad after such things. Not to be offended with other men's
liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy. Him also I must
thank, that ever I heard first Bacchius, then Tandasis and Marcianus,
and that I did write dialogues in my youth; and that I took liking to
the philosophers' little couch and skins, and such other things, which
by the Grecian discipline are proper to those who profess philosophy.

 To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit
that my life wanted some redress and cure. And then, that I did not
fall into the ambition of ordinary sophists, either to write tracts
concerning the common theorems, or to exhort men unto virtue and the
study of philosophy by public orations; as also that I never by way of
ostentation did affect to show myself an active able man, for any kind
of bodily exercises. And that I gave over the study of rhetoric and
poetry, and of elegant neat language. That I did not use to walk about
the house in my long robe, nor to do any such things. Moreover I learned
of him to write letters without any affectation, or curiosity; such as
that was, which by him was written to my mother from Sinuessa: and to be
easy and ready to be reconciled, and well pleased again with them that
had offended me, as soon as any of them would be content to seek unto
me again. To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and
superficial knowledge, nor quickly to assent to things commonly spoken
of: whom also I must thank that ever I lighted upon Epictetus his
_Hypomnemata_, or moral commentaries and common-factions: which also he
gave me of his own.

 From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not
to regard anything at all, though never so little, but right and reason:
and always, whether in the sharpest pains, or after the loss of a child,
or in long diseases, to be still the same man; who also was a present
and visible example unto me, that it was possible for the same man to
be both vehement and remiss: a man not subject to be vexed, and offended
with the incapacity of his scholars and auditors in his lectures and
expositions; and a true pattern of a man who of all his good gifts
and faculties, least esteemed in himself, that his excellent skill and
ability to teach and persuade others the common theorems and maxims of
the Stoic philosophy. Of him also I learned how to receive favours and
kindnesses (as commonly they are accounted:) from friends, so that I
might not become obnoxious unto them, for them, nor more yielding upon
occasion, than in right I ought; and yet so that I should not pass them
neither, as an unsensible and unthankful man.

 Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with
paternal affection; and a purpose to live according to nature: to be
grave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions
of my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor unseasonably to set
upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the theorems,
and tenets of philosophers: his conversation being an example how a man
might accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his
company were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer's cogging and
fawning; yet was it at the same time most respected and reverenced: who
also had a proper happiness and faculty, rationally and methodically to
find out, and set in order all necessary determinations and instructions
for a man's life. A man without ever the least appearance of anger, or
any other passion; able at the same time most exactly to observe the
Stoic _Apathia_, or unpassionateness, and yet to be most tender-hearted:
ever of good credit; and yet almost without any noise, or rumour: very
learned, and yet making little show.

 From Alexander the Grammarian, to be un-reprovable myself, and not
reproachfully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or
any false pronunciation, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony,
or confirmation of the same matter (taking no notice of the word) to
utter it as it should have been spoken; or by some other such close and
indirect admonition, handsomely and civilly to tell him of it.

 Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a
tyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called
εὐπατρίδαι, _i.e._ nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void
of natural affection.

 Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to
say, or to write to any man in a letter, 'I am not at leisure'; nor in
this manner still to put off those duties, which we owe to our friends
and acquaintances (to every one in his kind) under pretence of urgent
affairs.

 Of Catulus, not to contemn any friend's expostulation, though unjust,
but to strive to reduce him to his former disposition: freely and
heartily to speak well of all my masters upon any occasion, as it is
reported of Domitius, and Athenodotus: and to love my children with true
affection.

 From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all them of my
house and family; by whom also I came to the knowledge of Thrasea and
Helvidius, and Cato, and Dio, and Brutus. He it was also that did put me
in the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth, administered
by justice and equality; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded
nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects. Of him also,
to observe a constant tenor, (not interrupted, with any other cares and
distractions,) in the study and esteem of philosophy: to be bountiful
and liberal in the largest measure; always to hope the best; and to
be confident that my friends love me. In whom I moreover observed open
dealing towards those whom he reproved at any time, and that his friends
might without all doubt or much observation know what he would, or would
not, so open and plain was he.

 From Claudius Maximus, in all things to endeavour to have power
of myself, and in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and
courageous in all sudden chances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to
love mildness, and moderation, and gravity: and to do my business,
whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without querulousness. Whatsoever
he said, all men believed him that as he spake, so he thought, and
whatsoever he did, that he did it with a good intent. His manner was,
never to wonder at anything; never to be in haste, and yet never
slow: nor to be perplexed, or dejected, or at any time unseemly, or
excessively to laugh: nor to be angry, or suspicious, but ever ready to
do good, and to forgive, and to speak truth; and all this, as one that
seemed rather of himself to have been straight and right, than ever to
have been rectified or redressed; neither was there any man that ever
thought himself undervalued by him, or that could find in his heart, to
think himself a better man than he. He would also be very pleasant and
gracious.

 In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without
wavering in those things, which after a due examination and
deliberation, he had determined. How free from all vanity he carried
himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are esteemed:) his
laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had
aught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially
he would give every man his due; his skill and knowledge, when rigour
or extremity, or when remissness or moderation was in season; how he did
abstain from all unchaste love of youths; his moderate condescending to
other men's occasions as an ordinary man, neither absolutely requiring
of his friends, that they should wait upon him at his ordinary meals,
nor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and
that whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put
off and omitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he
went about it again, the same man that he was before. His accurate
examination of things in consultations, and patient hearing of others.
He would not hastily give over the search of the matter, as one easy to
be satisfied with sudden notions and apprehensions. His care to preserve
his friends; how neither at any time he would carry himself towards them
with disdainful neglect, and grow weary of them; nor yet at any time
be madly fond of them. His contented mind in all things, his cheerful
countenance, his care to foresee things afar off, and to take order for
the least, without any noise or clamour. Moreover how all acclamations
and flattery were repressed by him: how carefully he observed all things
necessary to the government, and kept an account of the common expenses,
and how patiently he did abide that he was reprehended by some for this
his strict and rigid kind of dealing. How he was neither a superstitious
worshipper of the gods, nor an ambitious pleaser of men, or studious of
popular applause; but sober in all things, and everywhere observant of
that which was fitting; no affecter of novelties: in those things which
conduced to his ease and convenience, (plenty whereof his fortune
did afford him,) without pride and bragging, yet with all freedom and
liberty: so that as he did freely enjoy them without any anxiety or
affectation when they were present; so when absent, he found no want
of them. Moreover, that he was never commended by any man, as either a
learned acute man, or an obsequious officious man, or a fine orator; but
as a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to
be flattered; able to govern both himself and others. Moreover, how much
he did honour all true philosophers, without upbraiding those that were
not so; his sociableness, his gracious and delightful conversation, but
never unto satiety; his care of his body within bounds and measure,
not as one that desired to live long, or over-studious of neatness, and
elegancy; and yet not as one that did not regard it: so that through his
own care and providence, he seldom needed any inward physic, or outward
applications: but especially how ingeniously he would yield to any that
had obtained any peculiar faculty, as either eloquence, or the knowledge
of the laws, or of ancient customs, or the like; and how he concurred
with them, in his best care and endeavour that every one of them might
in his kind, for that wherein he excelled, be regarded and esteemed: and
although he did all things carefully after the ancient customs of his
forefathers, yet even of this was he not desirous that men should take
notice, that he did imitate ancient customs. Again, how he was not
easily moved and tossed up and down, but loved to be constant, both in
the same places and businesses; and how after his great fits of headache
he would return fresh and vigorous to his wonted affairs. Again, that
secrets he neither had many, nor often, and such only as concerned
public matters: his discretion and moderation, in exhibiting of the
public sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people: in
public buildings. congiaries, and the like. In all these things,
having a respect unto men only as men, and to the equity of the things
themselves, and not unto the glory that might follow. Never wont to
use the baths at unseasonable hours; no builder; never curious, or
solicitous, either about his meat, or about the workmanship, or colour
of his clothes, or about anything that belonged to external beauty.
In all his conversation, far from all inhumanity, all boldness, and
incivility, all greediness and impetuosity; never doing anything with
such earnestness, and intention, that a man could say of him, that
he did sweat about it: but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at
leisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably. A man might
have applied that to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that he knew
how to want, and to enjoy those things, in the want whereof, most men
show themselves weak; and in the fruition, intemperate: but to hold out
firm and constant, and to keep within the compass of true moderation and
sobriety in either estate, is proper to a man, who hath a perfect and
invincible soul; such as he showed himself in the sickness of Maximus.

 From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents,
a good sister, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all
that I have; and that I never through haste and rashness transgressed
against any of them, notwithstanding that my disposition was such,
as that such a thing (if occasion had been) might very well have been
committed by me, but that It was the mercy of the gods, to prevent such
a concurring of matters and occasions, as might make me to incur this
blame. That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father;
that I preserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be
a man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed. That
I lived under the government of my lord and father, who would take
away from me all pride and vainglory, and reduce me to that conceit and
opinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court
without a troop of guards and followers, extraordinary apparel, such
and such torches and statues, and other like particulars of state and
magnificence; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to
the state of a private man, and yet for all that not to become the more
base and remiss in those public matters and affairs, wherein power and
authority is requisite. That I have had such a brother, who by his own
example might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and
love, delight and please me. That I have got ingenuous children, and
that they were not born distorted, nor with any other natural deformity.
That I was no great proficient in the study of rhetoric and poetry, and
of other faculties, which perchance I might have dwelt upon, if I had
found myself to go on in them with success. That I did by times prefer
those, by whom I was brought up, to such places and dignities, which
they seemed unto me most to desire; and that I did not put them off with
hope and expectation, that (since that they were yet but young) I would
do the same hereafter. That I ever knew Apollonius and Rusticus, and
Maximus. That I have had occasion often and effectually to consider and
meditate with myself, concerning that life which is according to nature,
what the nature and manner of it is: so that as for the gods and such
suggestions, helps and inspirations, as might be expected from them,
nothing did hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live
according to nature; or that even now that I was not yet partaker and
in present possession of that life, that I myself (in that I did not
observe those inward motions, and suggestions, yea and almost plain and
apparent instructions and admonitions of the gods,) was the only cause
of it. That my body in such a life, hath been able to hold out so long.
That I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards
when I fell into some fits of love, I was soon cured. That having been
often displeased with Rusticus, I never did him anything for which
afterwards I had occasion to repent. That it being so that my mother was
to die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. That as often
as I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or
fallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers
that there was not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never
had occasion to require the like succour from any other. That I have
such a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous. That I had choice of
fit and able men, to whom I might commit the bringing up of my children.
That by dreams I have received help, as for other things, so in
particular, how I might stay my casting of blood, and cure my dizziness,
as that also that happened to thee in Cajeta, as unto Chryses when he
prayed by the seashore. And when I did first apply myself to philosophy,
that I did not fall into the hands of some sophists, or spent my time
either in reading the manifold volumes of ordinary philosophers, nor in
practising myself in the solution of arguments and fallacies, nor dwelt
upon the studies of the meteors, and other natural curiosities. All
these things without the assistance of the gods, and fortune, could not
have been.

 In the country of the Quadi at Granua, these. Betimes in the morning
say to thyself, This day I shalt have to do with an idle curious man,
with an unthankful man, a railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man; an
unsociable uncharitable man. All these ill qualities have happened unto
them, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad. But I
that understand the nature of that which is good, that it only is to
be desired, and of that which is bad, that it only is truly odious and
shameful: who know moreover, that this transgressor, whosoever he be, is
my kinsman, not by the same blood and seed, but by participation of the
same reason, and of the same divine particle; How can I either be
hurt by any of those, since it is not in their power to make me incur
anything that is truly reproachful? or angry, and ill affected towards
him, who by nature is so near unto me? for we are all born to be
fellow-workers, as the feet, the hands, and the eyelids; as the rows of
the upper and under teeth: for such therefore to be in opposition, is
against nature; and what is it to chafe at, and to be averse from, but
to be in opposition?

 Whatsoever I am, is either flesh, or life, or that which we
commonly call the mistress and overruling part of man; reason. Away with
thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to
and fro; for it will not be; but as even now ready to die, think little
of thy flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and
twisted work, consisting of nerves, veins and arteries; think no more of
it, than so. And as for thy life, consider what it is; a wind; not one
constant wind neither, but every moment of an hour let out, and sucked
in again. The third, is thy ruling part; and here consider; Thou art an
old man; suffer not that excellent part to be brought in subjection, and
to become slavish: suffer it not to be drawn up and down with
unreasonable and unsociable lusts and motions, as it were with wires and
nerves; suffer it not any more, either to repine at anything now
present, or to fear and fly anything to come, which the destiny hath
appointed thee.

 Whatsoever proceeds from the gods immediately, that any man will
grant totally depends from their divine providence. As for those
things that are commonly said to happen by fortune, even those must be
conceived to have dependence from nature, or from that first and general
connection, and concatenation of all those things, which more apparently
by the divine providence are administered and brought to pass.
All things flow from thence: and whatsoever it is that is, is both
necessary, and conducing to the whole (part of which thou art), and
whatsoever it is that is requisite and necessary for the preservation of
the general, must of necessity for every particular nature, be good and
behoveful. And as for the whole, it is preserved, as by the perpetual
mutation and conversion of the simple elements one into another, so
also by the mutation, and alteration of things mixed and compounded. Let
these things suffice thee; let them be always unto thee, as thy general
rules and precepts. As for thy thirst after books, away with it with all
speed, that thou die not murmuring and complaining, but truly meek and
well satisfied, and from thy heart thankful unto the gods.

 Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how
often a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by
the gods, thou hast neglected it. It is high time for thee to understand
the true nature both of the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that
Lord and Governor of the world, from whom, as a channel from the spring,
thou thyself didst flow: and that there is but a certain limit of time
appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of to calm and
allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with
it, and never after return.

 Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to
perform whatsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned
gravity, natural affection, freedom and justice: and as for all other
cares, and imaginations, how thou mayest ease thy mind of them. Which
thou shalt do; if thou shalt go about every action as thy last action,
free from all vanity, all passionate and wilful aberration from reason,
and from all hypocrisy, and self-love, and dislike of those things,
which by the fates or appointment of God have happened unto thee. Thou
seest that those things, which for a man to hold on in a prosperous
course, and to live a divine life, are requisite and necessary, are not
many, for the gods will require no more of any man, that shall but keep
and observe these things.

 Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time
for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man's happiness
depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles
affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in
the souls, and conceits of other men.

 Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much
distract thee? Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease
roving and wandering to and fro. Thou must also take heed of another
kind of wandering, for they are idle in their actions, who toil and
labour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct all
their motions, and desires.  For not observing the state of another
man's soul, scarce was ever any man known to be unhappy. Tell whosoever
they be that intend not, and guide not by reason and discretion the
motions of their own souls, they must of necessity be unhappy.

 These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature
of the universe, and what is mine--in particular: This unto that what
relation it hath: what kind of part, of what kind of universe it is: And
that there is nobody that can hinder thee, but that thou mayest always
both do and speak those things which are agreeable to that nature,
whereof thou art a part.

 Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar
sense such things I grant may be compared:) says well and like a
philosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through
lust, than those which are committed through anger. For he that is angry
seems with a kind of grief and close contraction of himself, to turn
away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome by
pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike
disposition. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of
the two is the more to be condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he
that sins with grief. For indeed this latter may seem first to have been
wronged, and so in some manner through grief thereof to have been forced
to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit anything, did of
himself merely resolve upon that action.

 Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do,
and so project all, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very
present depart out of this life. And as for death, if there be any gods,
it is no grievous thing to leave the society of men. The gods will do
thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that there be no
gods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to
live in a world void of gods, and of all divine providence? But gods
there be certainly, and they take care for the world; and as for those
things which be truly evil, as vice and wickedness, such things they
have put in a man's own power, that he might avoid them if he would: and
had there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, they
would have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it.
But why should that be thought to hurt and prejudice a man's life in
this world, which cannot any ways make man himself the better, or the
worse in his own person? Neither must we think that the nature of the
universe did either through ignorance pass these things, or if not as
ignorant of them, yet as unable either to prevent, or better to order
and dispose them. It cannot be that she through want either of power or
skill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things
both good and bad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both
good and bad. As for life therefore, and death, honour and dishonour,
labour and pleasure, riches and poverty, all these things happen
unto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as things which of
themselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither
shameful nor praiseworthy.

 Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the
bodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the
world: and their memories into the general age and time of the world.
Consider the nature of all worldly sensible things; of those especially,
which either ensnare by pleasure, or for their irksomeness are dreadful,
or for their outward lustre and show are in great esteem and request,
how vile and contemptible, how base and corruptible, how destitute of
all true life and being they are.

 It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to
consider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits
and voices, honour and credit do proceed: as also what it is to die, and
how if a man shall consider this by itself alone, to die, and separate
from it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent
themselves unto us, he can conceive of it no otherwise, than as of a
work of nature, and he that fears any work of nature, is a very child.
Now death, it is not only a work of nature, but also conducing to
nature.

 Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined
unto God, and how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be
diffused. There is nothing more wretched than that soul, which in a kind
of circuit compasseth all things, searching (as he saith) even the very
depths of the earth; and by all signs and conjectures prying into the
very thoughts of other men's souls; and yet of this, is not sensible,
that it is sufficient for a man to apply himself wholly, and to confine
all his thoughts and cares to the tendance of that spirit which is
within him, and truly and really to serve him. His service doth consist
in this, that a man keep himself pure from all violent passion and
evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of
discontent, either in regard of the gods or men. For indeed whatsoever
proceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency;
and whatsoever proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us
be entertained, with love, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their
ignorance, of that which is truly good and bad, (a blindness no less,
than that by which we are not able to discern between white and black:)
with a kind of pity and compassion also.

 If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands
of years, yet remember this, that man can part with no life properly,
save with that little part of life, which he now lives: and that which
he lives, is no other, than that which at every instant he parts with.
That then which is longest of duration, and that which is shortest, come
both to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already past
there may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and
in being, is equal unto all men. And that being it which we part with
whensoever we die, it doth manifestly appear, that it can be but a
moment of time, that we then part with. For as for that which is either
past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part with it. For
how should a man part with that which he hath not? These two things
therefore thou must remember. First, that all things in the world from
all eternity, by a perpetual revolution of the same times and things
ever continued and renewed, are of one kind and nature; so that whether
for a hundred or two hundred years only, or for an infinite space of
time, a man see those things which are still the same, it can be no
matter of great moment. And secondly, that that life which any the
longest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and
duration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which
either of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that
which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.

 Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things
are plain and apparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic; and as
plain and apparent is the use that may be made of those things, if that
which is true and serious in them, be received as well as that which is
sweet and pleasing.

 A man's soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially,
when as much as in itself lies it becomes an aposteme, and as it were an
excrescency of the world, for to be grieved and displeased with anything
that happens in the world, is direct apostacy from the nature of the
universe; part of which, all particular natures of the world, are.
Secondly, when she either is averse from any man, or led by contrary
desires or affections, tending to his hurt and prejudice; such as are
the souls of them that are angry. Thirdly, when she is overcome by any
pleasure or pain. Fourthly, when she doth dissemble, and covertly and
falsely either doth or saith anything. Fifthly, when she doth either
affect or endeavour anything to no certain end, but rashly and without
due ratiocination and consideration, how consequent or inconsequent it
is to the common end. For even the least things ought not to be done,
without relation unto the end; and the end of the reasonable creatures
is, to follow and obey him, who is the reason as it were, and the law of
this great city, and ancient commonwealth.

 The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever
flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body
tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame
doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the
body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul.
Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no
better than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only
one thing, philosophy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to
preserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies
and injuries, and above all pains or pleasures; never to do anything
either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: wholly to depend from
himself and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to
embrace contentedly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came;
and above all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to
expect death, as being nothing else but the resolution of those
elements, of which every creature is composed. And if the elements
themselves suffer nothing by this their perpetual conversion of one into
another, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common unto all,
why should it be feared by any? Is not this according to nature? But
nothing that is according to nature can be evil.

 A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth and
decreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain,
whether his understanding shall continue so able and sufficient,
for either discreet consideration, in matter of businesses; or for
contemplation: it being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both
divine and human, doth depend. For if once he shall begin to dote,
his respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and appetitive, and other
natural faculties, may still continue the same: he shall find no want of
them. But how to make that right use of himself that he should, how
to observe exactly in all things that which is right and just, how to
redress and rectify all wrong, or sudden apprehensions and imaginations,
and even of this particular, whether he should live any longer or no, to
consider duly; for all such things, wherein the best strength and vigour
of the mind is most requisite; his power and ability will be past and
gone. Thou must hasten therefore; not only because thou art every day
nearer unto death than other, but also because that intellective faculty
in thee, whereby thou art enabled to know the true nature of things, and
to order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth daily waste and decay:
or, may fail thee before thou die.

 This also thou must observe, that whatsoever it is that naturally
doth happen to things natural, hath somewhat in itself that is pleasing
and delightful: as a great loaf when it is baked, some parts of it
cleave as it were, and part asunder, and make the crust of it rugged and
unequal, and yet those parts of it, though in some sort it be against
the art and intention of baking itself, that they are thus cleft and
parted, which should have been and were first made all even and uniform,
they become it well nevertheless, and have a certain peculiar property,
to stir the appetite. So figs are accounted fairest and ripest then,
when they begin to shrink, and wither as it were. So ripe olives, when
they are next to putrefaction, then are they in their proper beauty. The
hanging down of grapes--the brow of a lion, the froth of a foaming wild
boar, and many other like things, though by themselves considered, they
are far from any beauty, yet because they happen naturally, they both
are comely, and delightful; so that if a man shall with a profound mind
and apprehension, consider all things in the world, even among all those
things which are but mere accessories and natural appendices as it were,
there will scarce appear anything unto him, wherein he will not find
matter of pleasure and delight. So will he behold with as much pleasure
the true _rictus_ of wild beasts, as those which by skilful painters and
other artificers are imitated. So will he be able to perceive the proper
ripeness and beauty of old age, whether in man or woman: and whatsoever
else it is that is beautiful and alluring in whatsoever is, with chaste
and continent eyes he will soon find out and discern. Those and many
other things will he discern, not credible unto every one, but unto them
only who are truly and familiarly acquainted, both with nature itself,
and all natural things.

 Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and
died. The Chaldeans and Astrologians having foretold the deaths of
divers, were afterwards themselves surprised by the fates. Alexander and
Pompeius, and Caius Cæsar, having destroyed so many towns, and cut
off in the field so many thousands both of horse and foot, yet they
themselves at last were fain to part with their own lives. Heraclitus
having written so many natural tracts concerning the last and general
conflagration of the world, died afterwards all filled with water
within, and all bedaubed with dirt and dung without. Lice killed
Democritus; and Socrates, another sort of vermin, wicked ungodly men.
How then stands the case? Thou hast taken ship, thou hast sailed, thou
art come to land, go out, if to another life, there also shalt thou find
gods, who are everywhere. If all life and sense shall cease, then shalt
thou cease also to be subject to either pains or pleasures; and to serve
and tend this vile cottage; so much the viler, by how much that which
ministers unto it doth excel; the one being a rational substance, and a
spirit, the other nothing but earth and blood.

 Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning
other men, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it
thou art hindered from some other better work. That is, spend not thy
time in thinking, what such a man doth, and to what end: what he saith,
and what he thinks, and what he is about, and such other things or
curiosities, which make a man to rove and wander from the care and
observation of that part of himself, which is rational, and overruling.
See therefore in the whole series and connection of thy thoughts, that
thou be careful to prevent whatsoever is idle and impertinent: but
especially, whatsoever is curious and malicious: and thou must use
thyself to think only of such things, of which if a man upon a sudden
should ask thee, what it is that thou art now thinking, thou mayest
answer This, and That, freely and boldly, that so by thy thoughts it may
presently appear that in all thee is sincere, and peaceable; as becometh
one that is made for society, and regards not pleasures, nor gives way
to any voluptuous imaginations at all: free from all contentiousness,
envy, and suspicion, and from whatsoever else thou wouldest blush to
confess thy thoughts were set upon. He that is such, is he surely that
doth not put off to lay hold on that which is best indeed, a very priest
and minister of the gods, well acquainted and in good correspondence
with him especially that is seated and placed within himself, as in
a temple and sacrary: to whom also he keeps and preserves himself
unspotted by pleasure, undaunted by pain; free from any manner of wrong,
or contumely, by himself offered unto himself: not capable of any evil
from others: a wrestler of the best sort, and for the highest prize,
that he may not be cast down by any passion or affection of his own;
deeply dyed and drenched in righteousness, embracing and accepting with
his whole heart whatsoever either happeneth or is allotted unto him. One
who not often, nor without some great necessity tending to some public
good, mindeth what any other, either speaks, or doth, or purposeth: for
those things only that are in his own power, or that are truly his own,
are the objects of his employments, and his thoughts are ever taken
up with those things, which of the whole universe are by the fates or
Providence destinated and appropriated unto himself. Those things that
are his own, and in his own power, he himself takes order, for that they
be good: and as for those that happen unto him, he believes them to be
so. For that lot and portion which is assigned to every one, as it is
unavoidable and necessary, so is it always profitable. He remembers
besides that whatsoever partakes of reason, is akin unto him, and that
to care for all men generally, is agreeing to the nature of a man: but
as for honour and praise, that they ought not generally to be admitted
and accepted of from all, but from such only, who live according to
nature. As for them that do not, what manner of men they be at home,
or abroad; day or night, how conditioned themselves with what manner of
conditions, or with men of what conditions they moil and pass away
the time together, he knoweth, and remembers right well, he therefore
regards not such praise and approbation, as proceeding from them, who
cannot like and approve themselves.

 Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor
without due examination, nor with reluctancy. Affect not to set out thy
thoughts with curious neat language. Be neither a great talker, nor a
great undertaker. Moreover, let thy God that is in thee to rule over
thee, find by thee, that he hath to do with a man; an aged man; a
sociable man; a Roman; a prince; one that hath ordered his life, as
one that expecteth, as it were, nothing but the sound of the trumpet,
sounding a retreat to depart out of this life with all expedition. One
who for his word or actions neither needs an oath, nor any man to be a
witness.

 To be cheerful, and to stand in no need, either of other men's help
or attendance, or of that rest and tranquillity, which thou must be
beholding to others for. Rather like one that is straight of himself, or
hath ever been straight, than one that hath been rectified.

 If thou shalt find anything in this mortal life better than
righteousness, than truth, temperance, fortitude, and in general better
than a mind contented both with those things which according to right
and reason she doth, and in those, which without her will and knowledge
happen unto thee by the providence; if I say, thou canst find out
anything better than this, apply thyself unto it with thy whole heart,
and that which is best wheresoever thou dost find it, enjoy freely. But
if nothing thou shalt find worthy to be preferred to that spirit which
is within thee; if nothing better than to subject unto thee thine own
lusts and desires, and not to give way to any fancies or imaginations
before thou hast duly considered of them, nothing better than to
withdraw thyself (to use Socrates his words) from all sensuality, and
submit thyself unto the gods, and to have care of all men in general: if
thou shalt find that all other things in comparison of this, are but
vile, and of little moment; then give not way to any other thing, which
being once though but affected and inclined unto, it will no more be in
thy power without all distraction as thou oughtest to prefer and to
pursue after that good, which is thine own and thy proper good. For it
is not lawful, that anything that is of another and inferior kind and
nature, be it what it will, as either popular applause, or honour, or
riches, or pleasures; should be suffered to confront and contest as it
were, with that which is rational, and operatively good. For all these
things, if once though but for a while, they begin to please, they
presently prevail, and pervert a man's mind, or turn a man from the
right way. Do thou therefore I say absolutely and freely make choice of
that which is best, and stick unto it. Now, that they say is best, which
is most profitable. If they mean profitable to man as he is a rational
man, stand thou to it, and maintain it; but if they mean profitable, as
he is a creature, only reject it; and from this thy tenet and conclusion
keep off carefully all plausible shows and colours of external
appearance, that thou mayest be able to discern things rightly.

 Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain
thee either to break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man,
to suspect, to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that
requireth the secret of walls or veils. But he that preferreth before
all things his rational part and spirit, and the sacred mysteries of
virtue which issueth from it, he shall never lament and exclaim, never
sigh; he shall never want either solitude or company: and which is
chiefest of all, he shall live without either desire or fear. And as for
life, whether for a long or short time he shall enjoy his soul thus
compassed about with a body, he is altogether indifferent. For if even
now he were to depart, he is as ready for it, as for any other action,
which may be performed with modesty and decency. For all his life long,
this is his only care, that his mind may always be occupied in such
intentions and objects, as are proper to a rational sociable creature.

 In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst
not find anything, either foul or impure, or as it were festered:
nothing that is either servile, or affected: no partial tie; no
malicious averseness; nothing obnoxious; nothing concealed. The life of
such an one, death can never surprise as imperfect; as of an actor, that
should die before he had ended, or the play itself were at an end, a man
might speak.

 Use thine opinative faculty with all honour and respect, for in
her indeed is all: that thy opinion do not beget in thy understanding
anything contrary to either nature, or the proper constitution of a
rational creature. The end and object of a rational constitution is, to
do nothing rashly, to be kindly affected towards men, and in all things
willingly to submit unto the gods. Casting therefore all other things
aside, keep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man
properly can be said to live more than that which is now present, which
is but a moment of time. Whatsoever is besides either is already past,
or uncertain. The time therefore that any man doth live, is but a
little, and the place where he liveth, is but a very little corner of
the earth, and the greatest fame that can remain of a man after his
death, even that is but little, and that too, such as it is whilst it
is, is by the succession of silly mortal men preserved, who likewise
shall shortly die, and even whiles they live know not what in very deed
they themselves are: and much less can know one, who long before is dead
and gone.

 To these ever-present helps and mementoes, let one more be added,
ever to make a particular description and delineation as it were of
every object that presents itself to thy mind, that thou mayest wholly
and throughly contemplate it, in its own proper nature, bare and naked;
wholly, and severally; divided into its several parts and quarters: and
then by thyself in thy mind, to call both it, and those things of which
it doth consist, and in which it shall be resolved, by their own proper
true names, and appellations. For there is nothing so effectual to beget
true magnanimity, as to be able truly and methodically to examine and
consider all things that happen in this life, and so to penetrate
into their natures, that at the same time, this also may concur in our
apprehensions: what is the true use of it? and what is the true nature
of this universe, to which it is useful? how much in regard of the
universe may it be esteemed? how much in regard of man, a citizen of the
supreme city, of which all other cities in the world are as it were but
houses and families?

 What is this, that now my fancy is set upon? of what things doth
it consist? how long can it last? which of all the virtues is the proper
virtue for this present use? as whether meekness, fortitude, truth,
faith, sincerity, contentation, or any of the rest? Of everything
therefore thou must use thyself to say, This immediately comes from God,
this by that fatal connection, and concatenation of things, or (which
almost comes to one) by some coincidental casualty. And as for this, it
proceeds from my neighbour, my kinsman, my fellow: through his ignorance
indeed, because he knows not what is truly natural unto him: but I know
it, and therefore carry myself towards him according to the natural law
of fellowship; that is kindly, and justly. As for those things that of
themselves are altogether indifferent, as in my best judgment I conceive
everything to deserve more or less, so I carry myself towards it.

 If thou shalt intend that which is present, following the rule of
right and reason carefully, solidly, meekly, and shalt not intermix
any other businesses, but shall study this only to preserve thy spirit
unpolluted, and pure, and shall cleave unto him without either hope
or fear of anything, in all things that thou shalt either do or speak,
contenting thyself with heroical truth, thou shalt live happily; and
from this, there is no man that can hinder thee.

 As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready
at hand for all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a
readiness for the knowledge of things, both divine and human: and
whatsoever thou dost, even in the smallest things that thou dost, thou
must ever remember that mutual relation, and connection that is between
these two things divine, and things human. For without relation unto
God, thou shalt never speed in any worldly actions; nor on the other
side in any divine, without some respect had to things human.

 Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral
commentaries, nor the acts of the famous Romans and Grecians; nor those
excerpta from several books; all which thou hadst provided and laid
up for thyself against thine old age. Hasten therefore to an end, and
giving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest for
thyself, as thou oughtest to do.

 To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done
(which is not seen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight:) what
these words mean, and how many ways to be understood, they do not
understand. The body, the soul, the understanding. As the senses
naturally belong to the body, and the desires and affections to the
soul, so do the dogmata to the understanding.

 To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and
beast. To be violently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires of the
soul, is proper to wild beasts and monsters, such as Phalaris and Nero
were. To follow reason for ordinary duties and actions is common to them
also, who believe not that there be any gods, and for their advantage
would make no conscience to betray their own country; and who when once
the doors be shut upon them, dare do anything. If therefore all things
else be common to these likewise, it follows, that for a man to like and
embrace all things that happen and are destinated unto him, and not to
trouble and molest that spirit which is seated in the temple of his own
breast, with a multitude of vain fancies and imaginations, but to keep
him propitious and to obey him as a god, never either speaking anything
contrary to truth, or doing anything contrary to justice, is the only
true property of a good man. And such a one, though no man should
believe that he liveth as he doth, either sincerely and conscionably,
or cheerful and contentedly; yet is he neither with any man at all angry
for it, nor diverted by it from the way that leadeth to the end of his
life, through which a man must pass pure, ever ready to depart, and
willing of himself without any compulsion to fit and accommodate himself
to his proper lot and portion.

 That inward mistress part of man if it be in its own true natural
temper, is towards all worldly chances and events ever so disposed and
affected, that it will easily turn and apply itself to that which may
be, and is within its own power to compass, when that cannot be which at
first it intended. For it never doth absolutely addict and apply itself
to any one object, but whatsoever it is that it doth now intend and
prosecute, it doth prosecute it with exception and reservation; so that
whatsoever it is that falls out contrary to its first intentions, even
that afterwards it makes its proper object. Even as the fire when it
prevails upon those things that are in his way; by which things indeed a
little fire would have been quenched, but a great fire doth soon turn to
its own nature, and so consume whatsoever comes in his way: yea by those
very things it is made greater and greater.

 Let nothing be done rashly, and at random, but all things according
to the most exact and perfect rules of art.

 They seek for themselves private retiring
places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself
art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know
proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou
wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and
free from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than
to his own soul; he especially who is beforehand provided of such
things within, which whensoever he doth withdraw himself to look in, may
presently afford unto him perfect ease and tranquillity. By tranquillity
I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, free from
all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring
continually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts
be brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind,
may suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly, and to send thee away well
pleased with those things whatsoever they be, which now again after this
short withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou dost return unto. For
what is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wickedness of
men, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable
creatures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to
bear with them? and that it is against their wills that they offend?
and how many already, who once likewise prosecuted their enmities,
suspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now long ago stretched
out, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. As for
those things which among the common chances of the world happen unto
thee as thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with
any of them, when thou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind,
either a providence, or Democritus his atoms; and with it, whatsoever we
brought to prove that the whole world is as it were one city? And as for
thy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and
understanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own
power, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently,
or whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether
indifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto
concerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and
reputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou
dost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are
forgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will
follow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy
and variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of
the place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth
is but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very
little part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of
men are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou
often put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little
part of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction,
and intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things,
as a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is
to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among
other things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw
thyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that
the things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand
without still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is
within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next,
that all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little
while be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many
changes and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an
eyewitness of in thy time. This world is mere change, and this life,
opinion.

 If to understand and to be reasonable be common unto all men, then
is that reason, for which we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If
reason is general, then is that reason also, which prescribeth what is
to be done and what not, common unto all. If that, then law. If law,
then are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we partners in some one
commonweal. If so, then the world is as it were a city. For which other
commonweal is it, that all men can be said to be members of? From this
common city it is, that understanding, reason, and law is derived unto
us, for from whence else? For as that which in me is earthly I have from
some common earth; and that which is moist from some other element is
imparted; as my breath and life hath its proper fountain; and that
likewise which is dry and fiery in me: (for there is nothing which doth
not proceed from something; as also there is nothing that can be reduced
unto mere nothing:) so also is there some common beginning from whence
my understanding hath proceeded.

 As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature's wisdom: a
mixture of elements, resolved into the same elements again, a thing
surely which no man ought to be ashamed of: in a series of other fatal
events and consequences, which a rational creature is subject unto,
not improper or incongruous, nor contrary to the natural and proper
constitution of man himself.

 Such and such things, from such and such causes, must of necessity
proceed. He that would not have such things to happen, is as he that
would have the fig-tree grow without any sap or moisture. In sum,
remember this, that within a very little while, both thou and he shall
both be dead, and after a little while more, not so much as your names
and memories shall be remaining.

 Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged.
If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such
thing as wrong. That which makes not man himself the worse, cannot
make his life the worse, neither can it hurt him either inwardly
or outwardly. It was expedient in nature that it should be so, and
therefore necessary.

 Whatsoever doth happen in the world, doth happen justly, and so if
thou dost well take heed, thou shalt find it. I say not only in right
order by a series of inevitable consequences, but according to justice
and as it were by way of equal distribution, according to the true worth
of everything. Continue then to take notice of it, as thou hast begun,
and whatsoever thou dost, do it not without this proviso, that it be a
thing of that nature that a good man (as the word good is properly
taken) may do it. This observe carefully in every action.

 Conceit no such things, as he that wrongeth thee conceiveth,
or would have thee to conceive, but look into the matter itself, and see
what it is in very truth.

 These two rules, thou must have always in a readiness. First, do
nothing at all, but what reason proceeding from that regal and supreme
part, shall for the good and benefit of men, suggest unto thee. And
secondly, if any man that is present shall be able to rectify thee or to
turn thee from some erroneous persuasion, that thou be always ready to
change thy mind, and this change to proceed, not from any respect of any
pleasure or credit thereon depending, but always from some probable
apparent ground of justice, or of some public good thereby to be
furthered; or from some other such inducement.

 Hast thou reason? I have. Why then makest thou not use of it? For if
thy reason do her part, what more canst thou require?

 As a part hitherto thou hast had a particular subsistence: and now
shalt thou vanish away into the common substance of Him, who first begot
thee, or rather thou shalt be resumed again into that original rational
substance, out of which all others have issued, and are propagated.
Many small pieces of frankincense are set upon the same altar, one drops
first and is consumed, another after; and it comes all to one.

 Within ten days, if so happen, thou shalt be esteemed a god of
them, who now if thou shalt return to the dogmata and to the honouring
of reason, will esteem of thee no better than of a mere brute, and of an
ape.

 Not as though thou hadst thousands of years to live. Death hangs
over thee: whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.

 Now much time and leisure doth he gain, who is not curious to know
what his neighbour hath said, or hath done, or hath attempted, but only
what he doth himself, that it may be just and holy? or to express it in
Agathos' words, Not to look about upon the evil conditions of others,
but to run on straight in the line, without any loose and extravagant
agitation.

 He who is greedy of credit and reputation after his death, doth
not consider, that they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon
after every one of them be dead; and they likewise that succeed those;
until at last all memory, which hitherto by the succession of men
admiring and soon after dying hath had its course, be quite extinct.
But suppose that both they that shall remember thee, and thy memory
with them should be immortal, what is that to thee? I will not say to
thee after thou art dead; but even to thee living, what is thy praise?
But only for a secret and politic consideration, which we call
οἰκονομίαν, or dispensation. For as for that, that it is the gift of
nature, whatsoever is commended in thee, what might be objected from
thence, let that now that we are upon another consideration be omitted
as unseasonable. That which is fair and goodly, whatsoever it be, and
in what respect soever it be, that it is fair and goodly, it is so of
itself, and terminates in itself, not admitting praise as a part or
member: that therefore which is praised, is not thereby made either
better or worse. This I understand even of those things, that are
commonly called fair and good, as those which are commended either for
the matter itself, or for curious workmanship. As for that which is
truly good, what can it stand in need of more than either justice or
truth; or more than either kindness and modesty? Which of all those,
either becomes good or fair, because commended; or dispraised suffers
any damage? Doth the emerald become worse in itself, or more vile if it
be not commended? Doth gold, or ivory, or purple? Is there anything
that doth though never so common, as a knife, a flower, or a tree?

 If so be that the souls remain after death (say they that will not
believe it); how is the air from all eternity able to contain them? How
is the earth (say I) ever from that time able to Contain the bodies
of them that are buried? For as here the change and resolution of dead
bodies into another kind of subsistence (whatsoever it be;) makes place
for other dead bodies: so the souls after death transferred into the
air, after they have conversed there a while, are either by way of
transmutation, or transfusion, or conflagration, received again into
that original rational substance, from which all others do proceed:
and so give way to those souls, who before coupled and associated unto
bodies, now begin to subsist single. This, upon a supposition that the
souls after death do for a while subsist single, may be answered. And
here, (besides the number of bodies, so buried and contained by the
earth), we may further consider the number of several beasts, eaten
by us men, and by other creatures. For notwithstanding that such a
multitude of them is daily consumed, and as it were buried in the bodies
of the eaters, yet is the same place and body able to contain them, by
reason of their conversion, partly into blood, partly into air and fire.
What in these things is the speculation of truth? to divide things into
that which is passive and material; and that which is active and formal.

 Not to wander out of the way, but upon every motion and desire,
to perform that which is just: and ever to be careful to attain to the
true natural apprehension of every fancy, that presents itself.

 Whatsoever is expedient unto thee, O World, is expedient unto me;
nothing can either be 'unseasonable unto me, or out of date, which unto
thee is seasonable. Whatsoever thy seasons bear, shall ever by me be
esteemed as happy fruit, and increase. O Nature! from thee are all
things, in thee all things subsist, and to thee all tend. Could he say
of Athens, Thou lovely city of Cecrops; and shalt not thou say of the
world, Thou lovely city of God?

 They will say commonly, Meddle not with many things, if thou wilt
live cheerfully. Certainly there is nothing better, than for a man
to confine himself to necessary actions; to such and so many only, as
reason in a creature that knows itself born for society, will command
and enjoin. This will not only procure that cheerfulness, which from the
goodness, but that also, which from the paucity of actions doth usually
proceed. For since it is so, that most of those things, which we either
speak or do, are unnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must needs
follow that he shall thereby gain much leisure, and save much trouble,
and therefore at every action a man must privately by way of admonition
suggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I go about, be of the
number of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself to cut off
actions only, but thoughts and imaginations also, that are unnecessary
for so will unnecessary consequent actions the better be prevented and
cut off.

 Try also how a good man's life; (of one, who is well pleased with
those things whatsoever, which among the common changes and chances of
this world fall to his own lot and share; and can live well contented
and fully satisfied in the justice of his own proper present action,
and in the goodness of his disposition for the future:) will agree with
thee. Thou hast had experience of that other kind of life: make now
trial of this also. Trouble not thyself any more henceforth, reduce
thyself unto perfect simplicity. Doth any man offend? It is against
himself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee? Hath anything
happened unto thee? It is well, whatsoever it be, it is that which
of all the common chances of the world from the very beginning in the
series of all other things that have, or shall happen, was destinated
and appointed unto thee. To comprehend all in a few words, our life is
short; we must endeavour to gain the present time with best discretion
and justice. Use recreation with sobriety.

 Either this world is a κόσμος or comely piece, because all
disposed and governed by certain order: or if it be a mixture, though
confused, yet still it is a comely piece. For is it possible that in
thee there should be any beauty at all, and that in the whole world
there should be nothing but disorder and confusion? and all things in it
too, by natural different properties one from another differenced and
distinguished; and yet all through diffused, and by natural sympathy,
one to another united, as they are?

 A black or malign disposition, an effeminate disposition; an
hard inexorable disposition, a wild inhuman disposition, a sheepish
disposition, a childish disposition; a blockish, a false, a scurril, a
fraudulent, a tyrannical: what then? If he be a stranger in the world,
that knows not the things that are in it; why not be a stranger as well,
that wonders at the things that are done in it?

 He is a true fugitive, that flies from reason, by which men are
sociable. He blind, who cannot see with the eyes of his understanding.
He poor, that stands in need of another, and hath not in himself all
things needful for this life. He an aposteme of the world, who by being
discontented with those things that happen unto him in the world,
doth as it were apostatise, and separate himself from common nature's
rational administration. For the same nature it is that brings this
unto thee, whatsoever it be, that first brought thee into the world. He
raises sedition in the city, who by irrational actions withdraws his own
soul from that one and common soul of all rational creatures.

 There is, who without so much as a coat; and there is, who without
so much as a book, doth put philosophy in practice. I am half naked,
neither have I bread to eat, and yet I depart not from reason, saith
one. But I say; I want the food of good teaching, and instructions, and
yet I depart not from reason.

 What art and profession soever thou hast learned, endeavour to
affect it, and comfort thyself in it; and pass the remainder of thy life
as one who from his whole heart commits himself and whatsoever belongs
unto him, unto the gods: and as for men, carry not thyself either
tyrannically or servilely towards any.

 Consider in my mind, for example's sake, the times of Vespasian:
thou shalt see but the same things: some marrying, some bringing up
children, some sick, some dying, some fighting, some feasting, some
merchandising, some tilling, some flattering, some boasting, some
suspecting, some undermining, some wishing to die, some fretting and
murmuring at their present estate, some wooing, some hoarding, some
seeking after magistracies, and some after kingdoms. And is not that
their age quite over, and ended? Again, consider now the times of
Trajan. There likewise thou seest the very self-same things, and that
age also is now over and ended. In the like manner consider other
periods, both of times and of whole nations, and see how many men, after
they had with all their might and main intended and prosecuted some one
worldly thing or other did soon after drop away, and were resolved into
the elements. But especially thou must call to mind them, whom thou
thyself in thy lifetime hast known much distracted about vain things,
and in the meantime neglecting to do that, and closely and unseparably
(as fully satisfied with it) to adhere unto it, which their own proper
constitution did require. And here thou must remember, that thy carriage
in every business must be according to the worth and due proportion of
it, for so shalt thou not easily be tired out and vexed, if thou shalt
not dwell upon small matters longer than is fitting.

 Those words which once were common and ordinary, are now become
obscure and obsolete; and so the names of men once commonly known and
famous, are now become in a manner obscure and obsolete names. Camillus,
Cæso, Volesius, Leonnatus; not long after, Scipio, Cato, then Augustus,
then Adrianus, then Antoninus Pius: all these in a short time will
be out of date, and, as things of another world as it were, become
fabulous. And this I say of them, who once shined as the wonders of
their ages, for as for the rest, no sooner are they expired, than with
them all their fame and memory. And what is it then that shall always be
remembered? all is vanity. What is it that we must bestow our care and
diligence upon? even upon this only: that our minds and wills be just;
that our actions be charitable; that our speech be never deceitful, or
that our understanding be not subject to error; that our inclination be
always set to embrace whatsoever shall happen unto us, as necessary,
as usual, as ordinary, as flowing from such a beginning, and such a
fountain, from which both thou thyself and all things are.
Willingly therefore, and wholly surrender up thyself unto that fatal
concatenation, yielding up thyself unto the fates, to be disposed of at
their pleasure.

 Whatsoever is now present, and from day to day hath its existence;
all objects of memories, and the minds and memories themselves,
incessantly consider, all things that are, have their being by change
and alteration. Use thyself therefore often to meditate upon this, that
the nature of the universe delights in nothing more, than in altering
those things that are, and in making others like unto them. So that we
may say, that whatsoever is, is but as it were the seed of that which
shall be. For if thou think that that only is seed, which either the
earth or the womb receiveth, thou art very simple.

 Thou art now ready to die, and yet hast thou not attained to
that perfect simplicity: thou art yet subject to many troubles and
perturbations; not yet free from all fear and suspicion of external
accidents; nor yet either so meekly disposed towards all men, as thou
shouldest; or so affected as one, whose only study and only wisdom is,
to be just in all his actions.

 Behold and observe, what is the state of their rational part; and
those that the world doth account wise, see what things they fly and are
afraid of; and what things they hunt after.

 In another man's mind and understanding thy evil Cannot subsist,
nor in any proper temper or distemper of the natural constitution of thy
body, which is but as it were the coat or cottage of thy soul. Wherein
then, but in that part of thee, wherein the conceit, and apprehension
of any misery can subsist? Let not that part therefore admit any such
conceit, and then all is well. Though thy body which is so near it
should either be cut or burnt, or suffer any corruption or putrefaction,
yet let that part to which it belongs to judge of these, be still at
rest; that is, let her judge this, that whatsoever it is, that equally
may happen to a wicked man, and to a good man, is neither good nor evil.
For that which happens equally to him that lives according to nature,
and to him that doth not, is neither according to nature, nor against
it; and by consequent, neither good nor bad.

 Ever consider and think upon the world as being but one living
substance, and having but one soul, and how all things in the world, are
terminated into one sensitive power; and are done by one general motion
as it were, and deliberation of that one soul; and how all things that
are, concur in the cause of one another's being, and by what manner of
connection and concatenation all things happen.

 What art thou, that better and divine part excepted, but as
Epictetus said well, a wretched soul, appointed to carry a carcass up
and down?

 To suffer change can be no hurt; as no benefit it is, by change to
attain to being. The age and time of the world is as it were a flood and
swift current, consisting of the things that are brought to pass in
the world. For as soon as anything hath appeared, and is passed away,
another succeeds, and that also will presently out of sight.

 Whatsoever doth happen in the world, is, in the course of nature,
as usual and ordinary as a rose in the spring, and fruit in summer. Of
the same nature is sickness and death; slander, and lying in wait, and
whatsoever else ordinarily doth unto fools use to be occasion either
of joy or sorrow. That, whatsoever it is, that comes after, doth always
very naturally, and as it were familiarly, follow upon that which was
before. For thou must consider the things of the world, not as a loose
independent number, consisting merely of necessary events; but as a
discreet connection of things orderly and harmoniously disposed. There
is then to be seen in the things of the world, not a bare succession,
but an admirable correspondence and affinity.

 Let that of Heraclitus never be out of thy mind, that the death
of earth, is water, and the death of water, is air; and the death of
air, is fire; and so on the contrary. Remember him also who was
ignorant whither the way did lead, and how that reason being the thing
by which all things in the world are administered, and which men are
continually and most inwardly conversant with: yet is the thing, which
ordinarily they are most in opposition with, and how those things which
daily happen among them, cease not daily to be strange unto them, and
that we should not either speak, or do anything as men in their sleep,
by opinion and bare imagination: for then we think we speak and do, and
that we must not be as children, who follow their father's example; for
best reason alleging their bare καθότι παρειλήφαμεν; or, as by
successive tradition from our forefathers we have received it.

 Even as if any of the gods should tell thee, Thou shalt
certainly die to-morrow, or next day, thou wouldst not, except thou wert
extremely base and pusillanimous, take it for a great benefit, rather
to die the next day after, than to-morrow; (for alas, what is the
difference!) so, for the same reason, think it no great matter to die
rather many years after, than the very next day.

 Let it be thy perpetual meditation, how many physicians who
once looked so grim, and so theatrically shrunk their brows upon their
patients, are dead and gone themselves. How many astrologers, after that
in great ostentation they had foretold the death of some others, how
many philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and volumes concerning
either mortality or immortality; how many brave captains and commanders,
after the death and slaughter of so many; how many kings and tyrants,
after they had with such horror and insolency abused their power upon
men's lives, as though themselves had been immortal; how many, that
I may so speak, whole cities both men and towns: Helice, Pompeii,
Herculaneum, and others innumerable are dead and gone. Run them over
also, whom thou thyself, one after another, hast known in thy time
to drop away. Such and such a one took care of such and such a one's
burial, and soon after was buried himself. So one, so another: and all
things in a short time. For herein lieth all indeed, ever to look upon
all worldly things, as things for their continuance, that are but for a
day: and for their worth, most vile, and contemptible, as for example,
What is man? That which but the other day when he was conceived was vile
snivel; and within few days shall be either an embalmed carcass, or mere
ashes. Thus must thou according to truth and nature, throughly consider
how man's life is but for a very moment of time, and so depart meek and
contented: even as if a ripe olive falling should praise the ground that
bare her, and give thanks to the tree that begat her.

 Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though
the waves beat continually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are
those swelling waves stilled and quieted.

 Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I,
to whom this thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither
wounded by that which is present, nor in fear of that which is to come.
For as for this, it might have happened unto any man, but any man having
such a thing befallen him, could not have continued without grief. Why
then should that rather be an unhappiness, than this a happiness? But
however, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is no mischance
to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the nature
of man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature? What
then hast thou learned is the will of man's nature? Doth that then which
hath happened unto thee, hinder thee from being just? or magnanimous? or
temperate? or wise? or circumspect? or true? or modest? or free? or from
anything else of all those things in the present enjoying and possession
whereof the nature of man, (as then enjoying all that is proper unto
her,) is fully satisfied? Now to conclude; upon all occasion of sorrow
remember henceforth to make use of this dogma, that whatsoever it is
that hath happened unto thee, is in very deed no such thing of itself,
as a misfortune; but that to bear it generously, is certainly great
happiness.

 It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual
remedy against the fear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the
examples of such, who greedily and covetously (as it were) did for a
long time enjoy their lives. What have they got more, than they whose
deaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at the last?
as Cadiciant's, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their
lifetime having buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The
whole space of any man's life, is but little; and as little as it is,
with what troubles, with what manner of dispositions, and in the society
of how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be therefore unto thee
altogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look backward;
behold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee;
and as infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is
so infinite, what difference can there be between that which liveth but
three days, and that which liveth three ages?

 Let thy course ever be the most compendious way. The most
compendious, is that which is according to nature: that is, in all both
words and deeds, ever to follow that which is most sound and perfect.
For such a resolution will free a man from all trouble, strife,
dissembling, and ostentation.

 In the morning when thou findest thyself unwilling to rise, consider
with thyself presently, it is to go about a man's work that I am stirred
up. Am I then yet unwilling to go about that, for which I myself was
born and brought forth into this world? Or was I made for this, to
lay me down, and make much of myself in a warm bed? 'O but this is
pleasing.' And was it then for this that thou wert born, that thou
mightest enjoy pleasure? Was it not in very truth for this, that thou
mightest always be busy and in action? Seest thou not how all things
in the world besides, how every tree md plant, how sparrows and ants,
spiders and bees: how all in their kind are intent as it were orderly to
perform whatsoever (towards the preservation of this orderly universe)
naturally doth become and belong unto thin? And wilt not thou do that,
which belongs unto a man to do? Wilt not thou run to do that, which thy
nature doth require? 'But thou must have some rest.' Yes, thou must.
Nature hath of that also, as well as of eating and drinking, allowed
thee a certain stint. But thou guest beyond thy stint, and beyond that
which would suffice, and in matter of action, there thou comest short of
that which thou mayest. It must needs be therefore, that thou dost not
love thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst also love thy nature, and
that which thy nature doth propose unto herself as her end. Others,
as many as take pleasure in their trade and profession, can even pine
themselves at their works, and neglect their bodies and their food for
it; and doest thou less honour thy nature, than an ordinary mechanic
his trade; or a good dancer his art? than a covetous man his silver, and
vainglorious man applause? These to whatsoever they take an affection,
can be content to want their meat and sleep, to further that every one
which he affects: and shall actions tending to the common good of
human society, seem more vile unto thee, or worthy of less respect and
intention?

 How easy a thing is it for a man to put off from him all turbulent
adventitious imaginations, and presently to be in perfect rest and
tranquillity!

 Think thyself fit and worthy to speak, or to do anything that is
according to nature, and let not the reproach, or report of some that
may ensue upon it, ever deter thee. If it be right and honest to be
spoken or done, undervalue not thyself so much, as to be discouraged
from it. As for them, they have their own rational over-ruling part, and
their own proper inclination: which thou must not stand and look
about to take notice of, but go on straight, whither both thine own
particular, and the common nature do lead thee; and the way of both
these, is but one.

 I continue my course by actions according to nature, until I
fall and cease, breathing out my last breath into that air, by which
continually breathed in I did live; and falling upon that earth, out of
whose gifts and fruits my father gathered his seed, my mother her
blood, and my nurse her milk, out of which for so many years I have
been provided, both of meat and drink. And lastly, which beareth me that
tread upon it, and beareth with me that so many ways do abuse it, or
so freely make use of it, so many ways to so many ends.

 No man can admire thee for thy sharp acute language, such is thy
natural disability that way. Be it so: yet there be many other good
things, for the want of which thou canst not plead the want or natural
ability. Let them be seen in thee, which depend wholly from thee;
sincerity, gravity, laboriousness, contempt of pleasures; be not
querulous, be Content with little, be kind, be free; avoid all
superfluity, all vain prattling; be magnanimous. Doest not thou
perceive, how many things there be, which notwithstanding any pretence
of natural indisposition and unfitness, thou mightest have performed and
exhibited, and yet still thou doest voluntarily continue drooping
downwards? Or wilt thou say that it is through defect of thy natural
constitution, that thou art constrained to murmur, to be base and
wretched to flatter; now to accuse, and now to please, and pacify thy
body: to be vainglorious, to be so giddy-headed., and unsettled in thy
thoughts? nay (witnesses be the Gods) of all these thou mightest have
been rid long ago: only, this thou must have been contented with, to
have borne the blame of one that is somewhat slow and dull, wherein thou
must so exercise thyself, as one who neither doth much take to heart
this his natural defect, nor yet pleaseth himself in it.

 Such there be, who when they have done a good turn to any, are ready
to set them on the score for it, and to require retaliation. Others
there be, who though they stand not upon retaliation, to require any,
yet they think with themselves nevertheless, that such a one is their
debtor, and they know as their word is what they have done. Others again
there be, who when they have done any such thing, do not so much as
know what they have done; but are like unto the vine, which beareth her
grapes, and when once she hath borne her own proper fruit, is contented
and seeks for no further recompense. As a horse after a race, and a
hunting dog when he hath hunted, and a bee when she hath made her honey,
look not for applause and commendation; so neither doth that man that
rightly doth understand his own nature when he hath done a good turn:
but from one doth proceed to do another, even as the vine after she hath
once borne fruit in her own proper season, is ready for another time.
Thou therefore must be one of them, who what they do, barely do it
without any further thought, and are in a manner insensible of what they
do. 'Nay but,' will some reply perchance, 'this very thing a rational
man is bound unto, to understand what it is, that he doeth.' For it
is the property, say they, of one that is naturally sociable, to be
sensible, that he doth operate sociably: nay, and to desire, that the
party him self that is sociably dealt with, should be sensible of it
too. I answer, That which thou sayest is true indeed, but the true
meaning of that which is said, thou dost not understand. And therefore
art thou one of those first, whom I mentioned. For they also are led by
a probable appearance of reason. But if thou dost desire to understand
truly what it is that is said, fear not that thou shalt therefore give
over any sociable action.

 The form of the Athenians' prayer did run thus: 'O rain, rain, good
Jupiter, upon all the grounds and fields that belong to the Athenians.'
Either we should not pray at all, or thus absolutely and freely; and not
every one for himself in particular alone.

 As we say commonly, The physician hath prescribed unto this man,
riding; unto another, cold baths; unto a third, to go barefoot: so it
is alike to say, The nature of the universe hath prescribed unto this
man sickness, or blindness, or some loss, or damage or some such thing.
For as there, when we say of a physician, that he hath prescribed
anything, our meaning is, that he hath appointed this for that, as
subordinate and conducing to health: so here, whatsoever doth happen
unto any, is ordained unto him as a thing subordinate unto the fates,
and therefore do we say of such things, that they do συμβαίνειν, that
is, happen, or fall together; as of square stones, when either in
walls, or pyramids in a certain position they fit one another, and
agree as it were in an harmony, the masons say, that they do
συμβαίνειν; as if thou shouldest say, fall together: so that in the
general, though the things be divers that make it, yet the consent or
harmony itself is but one. And as the whole world is made up of all the
particular bodies of the world, one perfect and complete body, of the
same nature that particular bodies; so is the destiny of particular
causes and events one general one, of the same nature that particular
causes are. What I now say, even they that are mere idiots are not
ignorant of: for they say commonly τοῦτο ἔφερεν ἀυτῷ, that is, This
his destiny hath brought upon him. This therefore is by the fates
properly and particularly brought upon this, as that unto this in
particular is by the physician prescribed. These therefore let us
accept of in like manner, as we do those that are prescribed unto us
our physicians. For them also in themselves shall We find to contain
many harsh things, but we nevertheless, in hope of health, and
recovery, accept of them. Let the fulfilling and accomplishment of
those things which the common nature hath determined, be unto thee as
thy health. Accept then, and be pleased with whatsoever doth happen,
though otherwise harsh and un-pleasing, as tending to that end, to the
health and welfare of the universe, and to Jove's happiness and
prosperity. For this whatsoever it be, should not have been produced,
had it not conduced to the good of the universe. For neither doth any
ordinary particular nature bring anything to pass, that is not to
whatsoever is within the sphere of its own proper administration and
government agreeable and subordinate. For these two considerations then
thou must be well pleased with anything that doth happen unto thee.
First, because that for thee properly it was brought to pass, and unto
thee it was prescribed; and that from the very beginning by the series
and connection of the first causes, it hath ever had a reference unto
thee. And secondly, because the good success and perfect welfare, and
indeed the very continuance of Him, that is the Administrator of the
whole, doth in a manner depend on it. For the whole (because whole,
therefore entire and perfect) is maimed, and mutilated, if thou shalt
cut off anything at all, whereby the coherence, and contiguity as of
parts, so of causes, is maintained and preserved. Of which certain it
is, that thou doest (as much as lieth in thee) cut off, and in some
sort violently take somewhat away, as often as thou art displeased with
anything that happeneth.

 Be not discontented, be not disheartened, be not out of hope, if
often it succeed not so well with thee punctually and precisely to do
all things according to the right dogmata, but being once cast off,
return unto them again: and as for those many and more frequent
occurrences, either of worldly distractions, or human infirmities, which
as a man thou canst not but in some measure be subject unto, be not thou
discontented with them; but however, love and affect that only which
thou dust return unto: a philosopher's life, and proper occupation after
the most exact manner. And when thou dust return to thy philosophy,
return not unto it as the manner of some is, after play and liberty as
it were, to their schoolmasters and pedagogues; but as they that have
sore eyes to their sponge and egg: or as another to his cataplasm; or
as others to their fomentations: so shalt not thou make it a matter of
ostentation at all to obey reason but of ease and comfort. And
remember that philosophy requireth nothing of thee, but what thy
nature requireth, and wouldest thou thyself desire anything that is
not according to nature? for which of these sayest thou; that which is
according to nature or against it, is of itself more kind and pleasing?
Is it not for that respect especially, that pleasure itself is to so
many men's hurt and overthrow, most prevalent, because esteemed commonly
most kind, and natural? But consider well whether magnanimity rather,
and true liberty, and true simplicity, and equanimity, and holiness;
whether these be not most kind and natural? And prudency itself, what
more kind and amiable than it, when thou shalt truly consider with
thyself, what it is through all the proper objects of thy rational
intellectual faculty currently to go on without any fall or stumble?
As for the things of the world, their true nature is in a manner so
involved with obscurity, that unto many philosophers, and those no
mean ones, they seemed altogether incomprehensible, and the Stoics
themselves, though they judge them not altogether incomprehensible,
yet scarce and not without much difficulty, comprehensible, so that
all assent of ours is fallible, for who is he that is infallible in his
conclusions? From the nature of things, pass now unto their subjects
and matter: how temporary, how vile are they I such as may be in the
power and possession of some abominable loose liver, of some common
strumpet, of some notorious oppressor and extortioner. Pass from thence
to the dispositions of them that thou doest ordinarily converse with,
how hardly do we bear, even with the most loving and amiable! that I may
not say, how hard it is for us to bear even with our own selves, in such
obscurity, and impurity of things: in such and so continual a flux both
of the substances and time; both of the motions themselves, and things
moved; what it is that we can fasten upon; either to honour, and respect
especially; or seriously, and studiously to seek after; I cannot so much
as conceive For indeed they are things contrary.

 Thou must comfort thyself in the expectation of thy natural
dissolution, and in the meantime not grieve at the delay; but rest
contented in those two things. First, that nothing shall happen unto
thee, which is not according to the nature of the universe. Secondly,
that it is in thy power, to do nothing against thine own proper God, and
inward spirit. For it is not in any man's power to constrain thee to
transgress against him.

 What is the use that now at this present I make of my soul? Thus
from time to time and upon all occasions thou must put this question to
thyself; what is now that part of mine which they call the rational
mistress part, employed about? Whose soul do I now properly possess? a
child's? or a youth's? a woman's? or a tyrant's? some brute, or some
wild beast's soul?

 What those things are in themselves, which by the greatest part are
esteemed good, thou mayest gather even from this. For if a man shall
hear things mentioned as good, which are really good indeed, such as are
prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude, after so much heard and
conceived, he cannot endure to hear of any more, for the word good is
properly spoken of them. But as for those which by the vulgar are
esteemed good, if he shall hear them mentioned as good, he doth hearken
for more. He is well contented to hear, that what is spoken by the
comedian, is but familiarly and popularly spoken, so that even the
vulgar apprehend the difference. For why is it else, that this offends
not and needs not to be excused, when virtues are styled good: but that
which is spoken in commendation of wealth, pleasure, or honour, we
entertain it only as merrily and pleasantly spoken? Proceed therefore,
and inquire further, whether it may not be that those things also which
being mentioned upon the stage were merrily, and with great applause of
the multitude, scoffed at with this jest, that they that possessed them
had not in all the world of their own, (such was their affluence and
plenty) so much as a place where to avoid their excrements. Whether, I
say, those ought not also in very deed to be much respected, and
esteemed of, as the only things that are truly good.

 All that I consist of, is either form or matter. No corruption
can reduce either of these unto nothing: for neither did I of nothing
become a subsistent creature. Every part of mine then will by mutation
be disposed into a certain part of the whole world, and that in time
into another part; and so _in infinitum;_ by which kind of mutation, I
also became what I am, and so did they that begot me, and they before
them, and so upwards _in infinitum_. For so we may be allowed to speak,
though the age and government of the world, be to some certain periods
of time limited, and confined.

 Reason, and rational power, are faculties which content themselves
with themselves, and their own proper operations. And as for their first
inclination and motion, that they take from themselves. But their
progress is right to the end and object, which is in their way, as it
were, and lieth just before them: that is, which is feasible and
possible, whether it be that which at the first they proposed to
themselves, or no. For which reason also such actions are termed
κατορθώσεις, to intimate the directness of the way, by which they are
achieved. Nothing must be thought to belong to a man, which doth not
belong unto him as he is a man. These, the event of purposes, are not
things required in a man. The nature of man doth not profess any such
things. The final ends and consummations of actions are nothing at all
to a man's nature. The end therefore of a man, or the _summum bonum_
whereby that end is fulfilled, cannot consist in the consummation of
actions purposed and intended. Again, concerning these outward worldly
things, were it so that any of them did properly belong unto man, then
would it not belong unto man, to condemn them and to stand in opposition
with them. Neither would he be praiseworthy that can live without them;
or he good, (if these were good indeed) who of his own accord doth
deprive himself of any of them. But we see contrariwise, that the more a
man doth withdraw himself from these wherein external pomp and greatness
doth consist, or any other like these; or the better he doth bear with
the loss of these, the better he is accounted.

 Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are, such will thy
mind be in time. For the soul doth as it were receive its tincture from
the fancies, and imaginations. Dye it therefore and thoroughly soak it
with the assiduity of these cogitations. As for example. Wheresoever
thou mayest live, there it is in thy power to live well and happy. But
thou mayest live at the Court, there then also mayest thou live well and
happy. Again, that which everything is made for, he is also made unto
that, and cannot but naturally incline unto it. That which anything
doth naturally incline unto, therein is his end. Wherein the end of
everything doth consist, therein also doth his good and benefit consist.
Society therefore is the proper good of a rational creature. For that we
are made for society, it hath long since been demonstrated. Or can any
man make any question of this, that whatsoever is naturally worse and
inferior, is ordinarily subordinated to that which is better? and that
those things that are best, are made one for another? And those things
that have souls, are better than those that have none? and of those that
have, those best that have rational souls?

 To desire things impossible is the part of a mad man. But it is a
thing impossible, that wicked man should not commit some such things.
Neither doth anything happen to any man, which in the ordinary course
of nature as natural unto him doth not happen. Again, the same things
happen unto others also. And truly, if either he that is ignorant that
such a thing hath happened unto him, or he that is ambitious to be
commended for his magnanimity, can be patient, and is not grieved: is it
not a grievous thing, that either ignorance, or a vain desire to please
and to be commended, should be more powerful and effectual than true
prudence? As for the things themselves, they touch not the soul, neither
can they have any access unto it: neither can they of themselves any
ways either affect it, or move it. For she herself alone can affect and
move herself, and according as the dogmata and opinions are, which she
doth vouchsafe herself; so are those things which, as accessories, have
any co-existence with her.

 After one consideration, man is nearest unto us; as we are bound
to do them good, and to bear with them. But as he may oppose any of our
true proper actions, so man is unto me but as a thing indifferent: even
as the sun, or the wind, or some wild beast. By some of these it may be,
that some operation or other of mine, may be hindered; however, of my
mind and resolution itself, there can be no let or impediment, by reason
of that ordinary constant both exception (or reservation wherewith it
inclineth) and ready conversion of objects; from that which may not be,
to that which may be, which in the prosecution of its inclinations, as
occasion serves, it doth observe. For by these the mind doth turn and
convert any impediment whatsoever, to be her aim and purpose. So that
what before was the impediment, is now the principal object of her
working; and that which before was in her way, is now her readiest way.

 Honour that which is chiefest and most powerful in the world, and
that is it, which makes use of all things, and governs all things. So
also in thyself; honour that which is chiefest, and most powerful; and
is of one kind and nature with that which we now spake of. For it is the
very same, which being in thee, turneth all other things to its own use,
and by whom also thy life is governed.

 That which doth not hurt the city itself; cannot hurt any citizen.
This rule thou must remember to apply and make use of upon every conceit
and apprehension of wrong. If the whole city be not hurt by this,
neither am I certainly. And if the whole be not, why should I make it
my private grievance? consider rather what it is wherein he is overseen
that is thought to have done the wrong. Again, often meditate how
swiftly all things that subsist, and all things that are done in the
world, are carried away, and as it were conveyed out of sight: for both
the substance themselves, we see as a flood, are in a continual flux;
and all actions in a perpetual change; and the causes themselves,
subject to a thousand alterations, neither is there anything almost,
that may ever be said to be now settled and constant. Next unto this,
and which follows upon it, consider both the infiniteness of the time
already past, and the immense vastness of that which is to come, wherein
all things are to be resolved and annihilated. Art not thou then a
very fool, who for these things, art either puffed up with pride, or
distracted with cares, or canst find in thy heart to make such moans as
for a thing that would trouble thee for a very long time? Consider the
whole universe whereof thou art but a very little part, and the whole
age of the world together, whereof but a short and very momentary
portion is allotted unto thee, and all the fates and destinies together,
of which how much is it that comes to thy part and share! Again: another
doth trespass against me. Let him look to that. He is master of his own
disposition, and of his own operation. I for my part am in the meantime
in possession of as much, as the common nature would have me to possess:
and that which mine own nature would have me do, I do.

 Let not that chief commanding part of thy soul be ever subject to
any variation through any corporal either pain or pleasure, neither
suffer it to be mixed with these, but let it both circumscribe itself,
and confine those affections to their own proper parts and members.
But if at any time they do reflect and rebound upon the mind and
understanding (as in an united and compacted body it must needs;) then
must thou not go about to resist sense and feeling, it being natural.
However let not thy understanding to this natural sense and feeling,
which whether unto our flesh pleasant or painful, is unto us nothing
properly, add an opinion of either good or bad and all is well.

 To live with the Gods. He liveth with the Gods, who at all times
affords unto them the spectacle of a soul, both contented and well
pleased with whatsoever is afforded, or allotted unto her; and
performing whatsoever is pleasing to that Spirit, whom (being part of
himself) Jove hath appointed to every man as his overseer and governor.

 Be not angry neither with him whose breath, neither with him whose
arm holes, are offensive. What can he do? such is his breath naturally,
and such are his arm holes; and from such, such an effect, and such
a smell must of necessity proceed. 'O, but the man (sayest thou) hath
understanding in him, and might of himself know, that he by standing
near, cannot choose but offend.' And thou also (God bless thee!) hast
understanding. Let thy reasonable faculty, work upon his reasonable
faculty; show him his fault, admonish him. If he hearken unto thee, thou
hast cured him, and there will be no more occasion of anger.

 'Where there shall neither roarer be, nor harlot.' Why so? As
thou dost purpose to live, when thou hast retired thyself to some such
place, where neither roarer nor harlot is: so mayest thou here. And if
they will not suffer thee, then mayest thou leave thy life rather than
thy calling, but so as one that doth not think himself anyways wronged.
Only as one would say, Here is a smoke; I will out of it. And what a
great matter is this! Now till some such thing force me out, I will
continue free; neither shall any man hinder me to do what I will, and
my will shall ever be by the proper nature of a reasonable and sociable
creature, regulated and directed.

 That rational essence by which the universe is governed, is for
community and society; and therefore hath it both made the things that
are worse, for the best, and hath allied and knit together those
which are best, as it were in an harmony. Seest thou not how it hath
sub-ordinated, and co-ordinated? and how it hath distributed unto
everything according to its worth? and those which have the pre-eminency
and superiority above all, hath it united together, into a mutual
consent and agreement.

 How hast thou carried thyself hitherto towards the Gods? towards
thy parents? towards thy brethren? towards thy wife? towards thy
children? towards thy masters? thy foster-fathers? thy friends? thy
domestics? thy servants? Is it so with thee, that hitherto thou hast
neither by word or deed wronged any of them? Remember withal through how
many things thou hast already passed, and how many thou hast been able
to endure; so that now the legend of thy life is full, and thy charge is
accomplished. Again, how many truly good things have certainly by thee
been discerned? how many pleasures, how many pains hast thou passed over
with contempt? how many things eternally glorious hast thou despised?
towards how many perverse unreasonable men hast thou carried thyself
kindly, and discreetly?

 Why should imprudent unlearned souls trouble that which is
both learned, and prudent? And which is that that is so? she that
understandeth the beginning and the end, and hath the true knowledge of
that rational essence, that passeth through all things subsisting, and
through all ages being ever the same, disposing and dispensing as it
were this universe by certain periods of time.

 Within a very little while, thou wilt be either ashes, or a
sceletum; and a name perchance; and perchance, not so much as a name.
And what is that but an empty sound, and a rebounding echo? Those things
which in this life are dearest unto us, and of most account, they are in
themselves but vain, putrid, contemptible. The most weighty and serious,
if rightly esteemed, but as puppies, biting one another: or untoward
children, now laughing and then crying. As for faith, and modesty, and
justice, and truth, they long since, as one of the poets hath it, have
abandoned this spacious earth, and retired themselves unto heaven. What
is it then that doth keep thee here, if things sensible be so mutable
and unsettled? and the senses so obscure, and so fallible? and our souls
nothing but an exhalation of blood? and to be in credit among such,
be but vanity? What is it that thou dost stay for? an extinction, or a
translation; either of them with a propitious and contented mind. But
still that time come, what will content thee? what else, but to worship
and praise the Gods; and to do good unto men. To bear with them, and
to forbear to do them any wrong. And for all external things belonging
either to this thy wretched body, or life, to remember that they are
neither thine, nor in thy power.

 Thou mayest always speed, if thou wilt but make choice of the
right way; if in the course both of thine opinions and actions, thou
wilt observe a true method. These two things be common to the souls, as
of God, so of men, and of every reasonable creature, first that in their
own proper work they cannot be hindered by anything: and secondly, that
their happiness doth consist in a disposition to, and in the practice of
righteousness; and that in these their desire is terminated.

 If this neither be my wicked act, nor an act anyways depending
from any wickedness of mine, and that by it the public is not hurt; what
doth it concern me? And wherein can the public be hurt? For thou must
not altogether be carried by conceit and common opinion: as for help
thou must afford that unto them after thy best ability, and as occasion
shall require, though they sustain damage, but in these middle or
worldly things; but however do not thou conceive that they are truly
hurt thereby: for that is not right. But as that old foster-father
in the comedy, being now to take his leave doth with a great deal of
ceremony, require his foster-child's rhombus, or rattle-top, remembering
nevertheless that it is but a rhombus; so here also do thou likewise.
For indeed what is all this pleading and public bawling for at the
courts? O man, hast thou forgotten what those things are! yea but they
are things that others much care for, and highly esteem of. Wilt thou
therefore be a fool too? Once I was; let that suffice.

 Let death surprise me when it will, and where it will, I may be
εὔμοιρος, or a happy man, nevertheless.

For he is a happy man, who in his lifetime dealeth unto himself a happy
lot and portion. A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the
soul, good desires, good actions.

 The matter itself, of which the universe doth consist, is of itself
very tractable and pliable. That rational essence that doth govern it,
hath in itself no cause to do evil. It hath no evil in itself; neither
can it do anything that is evil: neither can anything be hurt by it. And
all things are done and determined according to its will and prescript.

 Be it all one unto thee, whether half frozen or well warm; whether
only slumbering, or after a full sleep; whether discommended or
commended thou do thy duty: or whether dying or doing somewhat else; for
that also 'to die,' must among the rest be reckoned as one of the duties
and actions of our lives.

 Look in, let not either the proper quality, or the true worth of
anything pass thee, before thou hast fully apprehended it.

 All substances come soon to their change, and either they shall
be resolved by way of exhalation (if so be that all things shall be
reunited into one substance), or as others maintain, they shall be
scattered and dispersed. As for that Rational Essence by which all
things are governed, as it best understandeth itself, both its own
disposition, and what it doth, and what matter it hath to do with and
accordingly doth all things; so we that do not, no wonder, if we wonder
at many things, the reasons whereof we cannot comprehend.

 The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.

 Let this be thy only joy, and thy only comfort, from one sociable
kind action without intermission to pass unto another, God being ever in
thy mind.

 The rational commanding part, as it alone can stir up and turn
itself; so it maketh both itself to be, and everything that happeneth,
to appear unto itself, as it will itself.

 According to the nature of the universe all things particular are
determined, not according to any other nature, either about compassing
and containing; or within, dispersed and contained; or without,
depending. Either this universe is a mere confused mass, and an
intricate context of things, which shall in time be scattered and
dispersed again: or it is an union consisting of order, and administered
by Providence. If the first, why should I desire to continue any longer
in this fortuit confusion and commixtion? or why should I take care for
anything else, but that as soon as may be I may be earth again? And
why should I trouble myself any more whilst I seek to please the Gods?
Whatsoever I do, dispersion is my end, and will come upon me whether I
will or no. But if the latter be, then am not I religious in vain;
then will I be quiet and patient, and put my trust in Him, who is the
Governor of all.

 Whensoever by some present hard occurrences thou art constrained to
be in some sort troubled and vexed, return unto thyself as soon as may
be, and be not out of tune longer than thou must needs. For so shalt
thou be the better able to keep thy part another time, and to maintain
the harmony, if thou dost use thyself to this continually; once out,
presently to have recourse unto it, and to begin again.

 If it were that thou hadst at one time both a stepmother, and
a natural mother living, thou wouldst honour and respect her also;
nevertheless to thine own natural mother would thy refuge, and recourse
be continually. So let the court and thy philosophy be unto thee. Have
recourse unto it often, and comfort thyself in her, by whom it is that
those other things are made tolerable unto thee, and thou also in those
things not intolerable unto others.

 How marvellous useful it is for a man to represent unto himself
meats, and all such things that are for the mouth, under a right
apprehension and imagination! as for example: This is the carcass of a
fish; this of a bird; and this of a hog. And again more generally; This
phalernum, this excellent highly commended wine, is but the bare juice
of an ordinary grape. This purple robe, but sheep's hairs, dyed with
the blood of a shellfish. So for coitus, it is but the attrition of an
ordinary base entrail, and the excretion of a little vile snivel, with
a certain kind of convulsion: according to Hippocrates his opinion. How
excellent useful are these lively fancies and representations of things,
thus penetrating and passing through the objects, to make their true
nature known and apparent! This must thou use all thy life long, and
upon all occasions: and then especially, when matters are apprehended
as of great worth and respect, thy art and care must be to uncover
them, and to behold their vileness, and to take away from them all those
serious circumstances and expressions, under which they made so grave
a show. For outward pomp and appearance is a great juggler; and then
especially art thou most in danger to be beguiled by it, when (to
a man's thinking) thou most seemest to be employed about matters of
moment.

 See what Crates pronounceth concerning Xenocrates himself.

 Those things which the common sort of people do admire, are most
of them such things as are very general, and may be comprehended under
things merely natural, or naturally affected and qualified: as stones,
wood, figs, vines, olives. Those that be admired by them that are more
moderate and restrained, are comprehended under things animated: as
flocks and herds. Those that are yet more gentle and curious, their
admiration is commonly confined to reasonable creatures only; not in
general as they are reasonable, but as they are capable of art, or of
some craft and subtile invention: or perchance barely to reasonable
creatures; as they that delight in the possession of many slaves. But
he that honours a reasonable soul in general, as it is reasonable and
naturally sociable, doth little regard anything else: and above all
things is careful to preserve his own, in the continual habit and
exercise both of reason and sociableness: and thereby doth co-operate
with him, of whose nature he doth also participate; God.

 Some things hasten to be, and others to be no more. And even
whatsoever now is, some part thereof hath already perished. Perpetual
fluxes and alterations renew the world, as the perpetual course of time
doth make the age of the world (of itself infinite) to appear always
fresh and new. In such a flux and course of all things, what of these
things that hasten so fast away should any man regard, since among all
there is not any that a man may fasten and fix upon? as if a man would
settle his affection upon some ordinary sparrow living by him, who is no
sooner seen, than out of sight. For we must not think otherwise of our
lives, than as a mere exhalation of blood, or of an ordinary respiration
of air. For what in our common apprehension is, to breathe in the air
and to breathe it out again, which we do daily: so much is it and no
more, at once to breathe out all thy respirative faculty into that
common air from whence but lately (as being but from yesterday, and
to-day), thou didst first breathe it in, and with it, life.

 Not vegetative spiration, it is not surely (which plants have) that
in this life should be so dear unto us; nor sensitive respiration, the
proper life of beasts, both tame and wild; nor this our imaginative
faculty; nor that we are subject to be led and carried up and down by
the strength of our sensual appetites; or that we can gather, and live
together; or that we can feed: for that in effect is no better, than
that we can void the excrements of our food. What is it then that should
be dear unto us? to hear a clattering noise? if not that, then neither
to be applauded by the tongues of men. For the praises of many tongues,
is in effect no better than the clattering of so many tongues. If then
neither applause, what is there remaining that should be dear unto thee?
This I think: that in all thy motions and actions thou be moved,
and restrained according to thine own true natural constitution and
Construction only. And to this even ordinary arts and professions do
lead us. For it is that which every art doth aim at, that whatsoever it
is, that is by art effected and prepared, may be fit for that work that
it is prepared for. This is the end that he that dresseth the vine, and
he that takes upon him either to tame colts, or to train up dogs,
doth aim at. What else doth the education of children, and all learned
professions tend unto? Certainly then it is that, which should be dear
unto us also. If in this particular it go well with thee, care not for
the obtaining of other things. But is it so, that thou canst not but
respect other things also? Then canst not thou truly be free? then canst
thou not have self-content: then wilt thou ever be subject to passions.
For it is not possible, but that thou must be envious, and jealous, and
suspicious of them whom thou knowest can bereave thee of such things;
and again, a secret underminer of them, whom thou seest in present
possession of that which is dear unto thee. To be short, he must of
necessity be full of confusion within himself, and often accuse the
Gods, whosoever stands in need of these things. But if thou shalt
honour and respect thy mind only, that will make thee acceptable
towards thyself, towards thy friends very tractable; and conformable
and concordant with the Gods; that is, accepting with praises whatsoever
they shall think good to appoint and allot unto thee.

 Under, above, and about, are the motions of the elements; but
the motion of virtue, is none of those motions, but is somewhat more
excellent and divine. Whose way (to speed and prosper in it) must be
through a way, that is not easily comprehended.

 Who can choose but wonder at them? They will not speak well of
them that are at the same time with them, and live with them; yet they
themselves are very ambitious, that they that shall follow, whom they
have never seen, nor shall ever see, should speak well of them. As if
a man should grieve that he hath not been commended by them, that lived
before him.

 Do not ever conceive anything impossible to man, which by thee
cannot, or not without much difficulty be effected; but whatsoever in
general thou canst Conceive possible and proper unto any man, think that
very possible unto thee also.

 Suppose that at the palestra somebody hath all to-torn thee with
his nails, and hath broken thy head. Well, thou art wounded. Yet thou
dost not exclaim; thou art not offended with him. Thou dost not suspect
him for it afterwards, as one that watcheth to do thee a mischief. Yea
even then, though thou dost thy best to save thyself from him, yet not
from him as an enemy. It is not by way of any suspicious indignation,
but by way of gentle and friendly declination. Keep the same mind and
disposition in other parts of thy life also. For many things there be,
which we must conceit and apprehend, as though we had had to do with an
antagonist at the palestra. For as I said, it is very possible for us to
avoid and decline, though we neither suspect, nor hate.

 If anybody shall reprove me, and shall make it apparent unto me,
that in any either opinion or action of mine I do err, I will most
gladly retract. For it is the truth that I seek after, by which I am
sure that never any man was hurt; and as sure, that he is hurt that
continueth in any error, or ignorance whatsoever.

 I for my part will do what belongs unto me; as for other things,
whether things unsensible or things irrational; or if rational, yet
deceived and ignorant of the true way, they shall not trouble or
distract me. For as for those creatures which are not endued with reason
and all other things and-matters of the world whatsoever I freely, and
generously, as one endued with reason, of things that have none, make
use of them. And as for men, towards them as naturally partakers of the
same reason, my care is to carry myself sociably. But whatsoever it is
that thou art about, remember to call upon the Gods. And as for the time
how long thou shalt live to do these things, let it be altogether
indifferent unto thee, for even three such hours are sufficient.

 Alexander of Macedon, and he that dressed his mules, when once
dead both came to one. For either they were both resumed into those
original rational essences from whence all things in the world are
propagated; or both after one fashion were scattered into atoms.

XXIII Consider how many different things, whether they concern our
bodies, or our souls, in a moment of time come to pass in every one of
us, and so thou wilt not wonder if many more things or rather all things
that are done, can at one time subsist, and coexist in that both one and
general, which we call the world.

 if any should put this question unto thee, how this word Antoninus
is written, wouldst thou not presently fix thine intention upon it, and
utter out in order every letter of it? And if any shall begin to gainsay
thee, and quarrel with thee about it; wilt thou quarrel with him again,
or rather go on meekly as thou hast begun, until thou hast numbered out
every letter? Here then likewise remember, that every duty that belongs
unto a man doth consist of some certain letters or numbers as it were,
to which without any noise or tumult keeping thyself thou must orderly
proceed to thy proposed end, forbearing to quarrel with him that would
quarrel and fall out with thee.

 Is it not a cruel thing to forbid men to affect those things, which
they conceive to agree best with their own natures, and to tend most
to their own proper good and behoof? But thou after a sort deniest them
this liberty, as often as thou art angry with them for their sins. For
surely they are led unto those sins whatsoever they be, as to
their proper good and commodity. But it is not so (thou wilt object
perchance). Thou therefore teach them better, and make it appear unto
them: but be not thou angry with them.

 Death is a cessation from the impression of the senses, the
tyranny of the passions, the errors of the mind, and the servitude of
the body.

 If in this kind of life thy body be able to hold out, it is a
shame that thy soul should faint first, and give over, take heed, lest
of a philosopher thou become a mere Cæsar in time, and receive a new
tincture from the court. For it may happen if thou dost not take heed.
Keep thyself therefore, truly simple, good, sincere, grave, free
from all ostentation, a lover of that which is just, religious, kind,
tender-hearted, strong and vigorous to undergo anything that becomes
thee. Endeavour to continue such, as philosophy (hadst thou wholly and
constantly applied thyself unto it) would have made, and secured thee.
Worship the Gods, procure the welfare of men, this life is short.
Charitable actions, and a holy disposition, is the only fruit of this
earthly life.

 Do all things as becometh the disciple of Antoninus Pius.
Remember his resolute constancy in things that were done by him
according to reason, his equability in all things, his sanctity; the
cheerfulness of his countenance, his sweetness, and how free he was from
all vainglory; how careful to come to the true and exact knowledge of
matters in hand, and how he would by no means give over till he did
fully, and plainly understand the whole state of the business; and how
patiently, and without any contestation he would bear with them, that
did unjustly condemn him: how he would never be over-hasty in anything,
nor give ear to slanders and false accusations, but examine and observe
with best diligence the several actions and dispositions of men. Again,
how he was no backbiter, nor easily frightened, nor suspicious, and in
his language free from all affectation and curiosity: and how easily he
would content himself with few things, as lodging, bedding, clothing,
and ordinary nourishment, and attendance. How able to endure labour, how
patient; able through his spare diet to continue from morning to evening
without any necessity of withdrawing before his accustomed hours to
the necessities of nature: his uniformity and constancy in matter of
friendship. How he would bear with them that with all boldness and
liberty opposed his opinions; and even rejoice if any man could better
advise him: and lastly, how religious he was without superstition. All
these things of him remember, that whensoever thy last hour shall
come upon thee, it may find thee, as it did him, ready for it in the
possession of a good conscience.

 Stir up thy mind, and recall thy wits again from thy natural
dreams, and visions, and when thou art perfectly awoken, and canst
perceive that they were but dreams that troubled thee, as one newly
awakened out of another kind of sleep look upon these worldly things
with the same mind as thou didst upon those, that thou sawest in thy
sleep.

 I consist of body and soul. Unto my body all things are
indifferent, for of itself it cannot affect one thing more than another
with apprehension of any difference; as for my mind, all things which
are not within the verge of her own operation, are indifferent unto her,
and for her own operations, those altogether depend of her; neither
does she busy herself about any, but those that are present; for as
for future and past operations, those also are now at this present
indifferent unto her.

 As long as the foot doth that which belongeth unto it to do, and
the hand that which belongs unto it, their labour, whatsoever it be, is
not unnatural. So a man as long as he doth that which is proper unto
a man, his labour cannot be against nature; and if it be not against
nature, then neither is it hurtful unto him. But if it were so that
happiness did consist in pleasure: how came notorious robbers, impure
abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so large a measure to
have their part of pleasures?

 Dost thou not see, how even those that profess mechanic arts,
though in some respect they be no better than mere idiots, yet they
stick close to the course of their trade, neither can they find in
their heart to decline from it: and is it not a grievous thing that
an architect, or a physician shall respect the course and mysteries of
their profession, more than a man the proper course and condition of his
own nature, reason, which is common to him and to the Gods?

 Asia, Europe; what are they, but as corners of the whole world;
of which the whole sea, is but as one drop; and the great Mount Athos,
but as a clod, as all present time is but as one point of eternity. All,
petty things; all things that are soon altered, soon perished. And all
things come from one beginning; either all severally and particularly
deliberated and resolved upon, by the general ruler and governor of all;
or all by necessary consequence. So that the dreadful hiatus of a gaping
lion, and all poison, and all hurtful things, are but (as the thorn and
the mire) the necessary consequences of goodly fair things. Think not
of these therefore, as things contrary to those which thou dost much
honour, and respect; but consider in thy mind the true fountain of all.

XXXIV He that seeth the things that are now, hath Seen all that either
was ever, or ever shall be, for all things are of one kind; and all like
one unto another. Meditate often upon the connection of all things in
the world; and upon the mutual relation that they have one unto another.
For all things are after a sort folded and involved one within another,
and by these means all agree well together. For one thing is consequent
unto another, by local motion, by natural conspiration and agreement,
and by substantial union, or, reduction of all substances into one.

 Fit and accommodate thyself to that estate and to those
occurrences, which by the destinies have been annexed unto thee; and
love those men whom thy fate it is to live with; but love them truly. An
instrument, a tool, an utensil, whatsoever it be, if it be fit for the
purpose it was made for, it is as it should be though he perchance that
made and fitted it, be out of sight and gone. But in things natural,
that power which hath framed and fitted them, is and abideth within them
still: for which reason she ought also the more to be respected, and we
are the more obliged (if we may live and pass our time according to her
purpose and intention) to think that all is well with us, and according
to our own minds. After this manner also, and in this respect it is,
that he that is all in all doth enjoy his happiness.

 What things soever are not within the proper power and
jurisdiction of thine own will either to compass or avoid, if thou shalt
propose unto thyself any of those things as either good, or evil; it
must needs be that according as thou shalt either fall into that which
thou dost think evil, or miss of that which thou dost think good, so
wilt thou be ready both to complain of the Gods, and to hate those men,
who either shall be so indeed, or shall by thee be suspected as the
cause either of thy missing of the one, or falling into the other. And
indeed we must needs commit many evils, if we incline to any of these
things, more or less, with an opinion of any difference. But if we mind
and fancy those things only, as good and bad, which wholly depend of our
own wills, there is no more occasion why we should either murmur against
the Gods, or be at enmity with any man.

 We all work to one effect, some willingly, and with a rational
apprehension of what we do: others without any such knowledge. As I
think Heraclitus in a place speaketh of them that sleep, that even they
do work in their kind, and do confer to the general operations of the
world. One man therefore doth co-operate after one sort, and another
after another sort; but even he that doth murmur, and to his power doth
resist and hinder; even he as much as any doth co-operate. For of such
also did the world stand in need. Now do thou consider among which of
these thou wilt rank thyself. For as for him who is the Administrator
of all, he will make good use of thee whether thou wilt or no, and make
thee (as a part and member of the whole) so to co-operate with him,
that whatsoever thou doest, shall turn to the furtherance of his own
counsels, and resolutions. But be not thou for shame such a part of the
whole, as that vile and ridiculous verse (which Chrysippus in a place
doth mention) is a part of the comedy.  Doth either the sun take
upon him to do that which belongs to the rain? or his son Aesculapius
that, which unto the earth doth properly belong? How is it with every
one of the stars in particular? Though they all differ one from another,
and have their several charges and functions by themselves, do they not
all nevertheless concur and co-operate to one end?

 If so be that the Gods have deliberated in particular of those
things that should happen unto me, I must stand to their deliberation,
as discrete and wise. For that a God should be an imprudent God, is a
thing hard even to conceive: and why should they resolve to do me hurt?
for what profit either unto them or the universe (which they specially
take care for) could arise from it? But if so be that they have not
deliberated of me in particular, certainly they have of the whole in
general, and those things which in consequence and coherence of this
general deliberation happen unto me in particular, I am bound to embrace
and accept of. But if so be that they have not deliberated at all (which
indeed is very irreligious for any man to believe: for then let us
neither sacrifice, nor pray, nor respect our oaths, neither let us any
more use any of those things, which we persuaded of the presence and
secret conversation of the Gods among us, daily use and practise:)
but, I say, if so be that they have not indeed either in general, or
particular deliberated of any of those things, that happen unto us
in this world; yet God be thanked, that of those things that
concern myself, it is lawful for me to deliberate myself, and all my
deliberation is but concerning that which may be to me most profitable.
Now that unto every one is most profitable, which is according to his
own constitution and nature. And my nature is, to be rational in all my
actions and as a good, and natural member of a city and commonwealth,
towards my fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly disposed and
affected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the
whole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to
those cities, are the only things that are good and expedient for me.

 Whatsoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the
whole. And thus much to content us might suffice, that it is expedient
for the whole in general. But yet this also shalt thou generally
perceive, if thou dost diligently take heed, that whatsoever doth happen
to any one man or men.... And now I am content that the word expedient,
should more generally be understood of those things which we otherwise
call middle things, or things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the
like.

 As the ordinary shows of the theatre and of other such places,
when thou art presented with them, affect thee; as the same things still
seen, and in the same fashion, make the sight ingrateful and tedious;
so must all the things that we see all our life long affect us. For all
things, above and below, are still the same, and from the same causes.
When then will there be an end?

 Let the several deaths of men of all sorts, and of all sorts of
professions, and of all sort of nations, be a perpetual object of thy
thoughts,... so that thou mayst even come down to Philistio, Phœbus,
and Origanion. Pass now to other generations. Thither shall we after
many changes, where so many brave orators are; where so many grave
philosophers; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Where so many heroes of
the old times; and then so many brave captains of the latter times; and
so many kings. After all these, where Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes;
where so many other sharp, generous, industrious, subtile, peremptory
dispositions; and among others, even they, that have been the greatest
scoffers and deriders of the frailty and brevity of this our human life;
as Menippus, and others, as many as there have been such as he. Of all
these consider, that they long since are all dead, and gone. And what do
they suffer by it! Nay they that have not so much as a name remaining,
what are they the worse for it? One thing there is, and that only, which
is worth our while in this world, and ought by us much to be esteemed;
and that is, according to truth and righteousness, meekly and lovingly
to converse with false, and unrighteous men.

 When thou wilt comfort and cheer thyself, call to mind the
several gifts and virtues of them, whom thou dost daily converse with;
as for example, the industry of the one; the modesty of another; the
liberality of a third; of another some other thing. For nothing can so
much rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several virtues,
visible and eminent in the dispositions of those who live with thee;
especially when, all at once, as near as may be, they represent
themselves unto thee. And therefore thou must have them always in a
readiness.

 Dost thou grieve that thou dost weigh but so many pounds, and not
three hundred rather? Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that
thou must live but so many years, and not longer. For as for bulk and
substance thou dost content thyself with that proportion of it that is
allotted unto thee, so shouldst thou for time.

 Let us do our best endeavours to persuade them; but however, if
reason and justice lead thee to it, do it, though they be never so much
against it. But if any shall by force withstand thee, and hinder thee in
it, convert thy virtuous inclination from one object unto another, from
justice to contented equanimity, and cheerful patience: so that what in
the one is thy hindrance, thou mayst make use of it for the exercise of
another virtue: and remember that it was with due exception, and
reservation, that thou didst at first incline and desire. For thou didst
not set thy mind upon things impossible. Upon what then? that all thy
desires might ever be moderated with this due kind of reservation. And
this thou hast, and mayst always obtain, whether the thing desired be in
thy power or no. And what do I care for more, if that for which I was
born and brought forth into the world (to rule all my desires with
reason and discretion) may be?

 The ambitious supposeth another man's act, praise and applause, to
be his own happiness; the voluptuous his own sense and feeling; but he
that is wise, his own action.

 It is in thy power absolutely to exclude all manner of conceit
and opinion, as concerning this matter; and by the same means, to
exclude all grief and sorrow from thy soul. For as for the things and
objects themselves, they of themselves have no such power, whereby to
beget and force upon us any opinion at all.

 Use thyself when any man speaks unto thee, so to hearken unto
him, as that in the interim thou give not way to any other thoughts;
that so thou mayst (as far as is possible) seem fixed and fastened to
his very soul, whosoever he be that speaks unto thee.

 That which is not good for the bee-hive, cannot be good for the
bee.

 Will either passengers, or patients, find fault and complain, either
the one if they be well carried, or the others if well cured? Do they
take care for any more than this; the one, that their shipmaster may
bring them safe to land, and the other, that their physician may effect
their recovery?

 How many of them who came into the world at the same time when I
did, are already gone out of it?

 To them that are sick of the jaundice, honey seems bitter; and to
them that are bitten by a mad dog, the water terrible; and to children,
a little ball seems a fine thing. And why then should I be angry? or
do I think that error and false opinion is less powerful to make men
transgress, than either choler, being immoderate and excessive, to cause
the jaundice; or poison, to cause rage?

 No man can hinder thee to live as thy nature doth require. Nothing
can happen unto thee, but what the common good of nature doth require.

 What manner of men they be whom they seek to please, and what to
get, and by what actions: how soon time will cover and bury all things,
and how many it hath already buried!

 What is wickedness? It is that which many time and often thou hast
already seen and known in the world. And so oft as anything doth happen
that might otherwise trouble thee, let this memento presently come to
thy mind, that it is that which thou hast already often Seen and known.
Generally, above and below, thou shalt find but the same things. The
very same things whereof ancient stories, middle age stories, and fresh
stories are full whereof towns are full, and houses full. There is
nothing that is new. All things that are, are both usual and of little
continuance.

 What fear is there that thy dogmata, or philosophical resolutions
and conclusions, should become dead in thee, and lose their proper
power and efficacy to make thee live happy, as long as those proper
and correlative fancies, and representations of things on which they
mutually depend (which continually to stir up and revive is in thy
power,) are still kept fresh and alive? It is in my power concerning
this thing that is happened, what soever it be, to conceit that which is
right and true. If it be, why then am I troubled? Those things that are
without my understanding, are nothing to it at all: and that is it only,
which doth properly concern me. Be always in this mind, and thou wilt be
right.

 That which most men would think themselves most happy for, and
would prefer before all things, if the Gods would grant it unto them
after their deaths, thou mayst whilst thou livest grant unto thyself; to
live again. See the things of the world again, as thou hast already seen
them. For what is it else to live again? Public shows and solemnities
with much pomp and vanity, stage plays, flocks and herds; conflicts
and contentions: a bone thrown to a company of hungry curs; a bait for
greedy fishes; the painfulness, and continual burden-bearing of wretched
ants, the running to and fro of terrified mice: little puppets drawn up
and down with wires and nerves: these be the objects of the world among
all these thou must stand steadfast, meekly affected, and free from all
manner of indignation; with this right ratiocination and apprehension;
that as the worth is of those things which a man doth affect, so is in
very deed every man's worth more or less.

 Word after word, every one by itself, must the things that are
spoken be conceived and understood; and so the things that are done,
purpose after purpose, every one by itself likewise. And as in matter of
purposes and actions, we must presently see what is the proper use and
relation of every one; so of words must we be as ready, to consider of
every one what is the true meaning, and signification of it according to
truth and nature, however it be taken in common use.

 Is my reason, and understanding sufficient for this, or no? If it be
sufficient, without any private applause, or public ostentation as of an
instrument, which by nature I am provided of, I will make use of it for
the work in hand, as of an instrument, which by nature I am provided of.
if it be not, and that otherwise it belong not unto me particularly as
a private duty, I will either give it over, and leave it to some other
that can better effect it: or I will endeavour it; but with the help
of some other, who with the joint help of my reason, is able to bring
somewhat to pass, that will now be seasonable and useful for the common
good. For whatsoever I do either by myself, or with some other, the
only thing that I must intend, is, that it be good and expedient for
the public. For as for praise, consider how many who once were much
commended, are now already quite forgotten, yea they that commended
them, how even they themselves are long since dead and gone. Be not
therefore ashamed, whensoever thou must use the help of others. For
whatsoever it be that lieth upon thee to effect, thou must propose it
unto thyself, as the scaling of walls is unto a soldier. And what if
thou through either lameness or some other impediment art not able to
reach unto the top of the battlements alone, which with the help of
another thou mayst; wilt thou therefore give it over, or go about it
with less courage and alacrity, because thou canst not effect it all
alone?

 Let not things future trouble thee. For if necessity so require that
they come to pass, thou shalt (whensoever that is) be provided for them
with the same reason, by which whatsoever is now present, is made both
tolerable and acceptable unto thee. All things are linked and knitted
together, and the knot is sacred, neither is there anything in the
world, that is not kind and natural in regard of any other thing, or,
that hath not some kind of reference and natural correspondence with
whatsoever is in the world besides. For all things are ranked together,
and by that decency of its due place and order that each particular
doth observe, they all concur together to the making of one and the same
κόσμος or world: as if you said, a comely piece, or an orderly
composition. For all things throughout, there is but one and the same
order; and through all things, one and the same God, the same substance
and the same law. There is one common reason, and one common truth, that
belongs unto all reasonable creatures, for neither is there save one
perfection of all creatures that are of the same kind, and partakers of
the same reason.

 Whatsoever is material, doth soon vanish away into the common
substance of the whole; and whatsoever is formal, or, whatsoever doth
animate that which is material, is soon resumed into the common reason
of the whole; and the fame and memory of anything, is soon swallowed up
by the general age and duration of the whole.

 To a reasonable creature, the same action is both according
to nature, and according to reason.

 Straight of itself, not made straight.

 As several members in one body united, so are reasonable creatures
in a body divided and dispersed, all made and prepared for one common
operation. And this thou shalt apprehend the better, if thou shalt use
thyself often to say to thyself, I am μέλος, or a member of the mass and
body of reasonable substances. But if thou shalt say I am μέρος, or
a part, thou dost not yet love men from thy heart. The joy that thou
takest in the exercise of bounty, is not yet grounded upon a due
ratiocination and right apprehension of the nature of things. Thou dost
exercise it as yet upon this ground barely, as a thing convenient and
fitting; not, as doing good to thyself, when thou dost good unto others.

 Of things that are external, happen what will to that which can
suffer by external accidents. Those things that suffer let them complain
themselves, if they will; as for me, as long as I conceive no such
thing, that that which is happened is evil, I have no hurt; and it is in
my power not to conceive any such thing.

 Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good; not for
any man's sake, but for thine own nature's sake; as if either gold, or
the emerald, or purple, should ever be saying to themselves, Whatsoever
any man either doth or saith, I must still be an emerald, and I must
keep my colour.

 This may ever be my comfort and security: my understanding, that
ruleth over all, will not of itself bring trouble and vexation upon
itself. This I say; it will not put itself in any fear, it will not lead
itself into any concupiscence. If it be in the power of any other to
compel it to fear, or to grieve, it is free for him to use his power.
But sure if itself do not of itself, through some false opinion or
supposition incline itself to any such disposition; there is no fear.
For as for the body, why should I make the grief of my body, to be the
grief of my mind? If that itself can either fear or complain, let it.
But as for the soul, which indeed, can only be truly sensible of either
fear or grief; to which only it belongs according to its different
imaginations and opinions, to admit of either of these, or of their
contraries; thou mayst look to that thyself, that it suffer nothing.
Induce her not to any such opinion or persuasion. The understanding
is of itself sufficient unto itself, and needs not (if itself doth not
bring itself to need) any other thing besides itself, and by consequent
as it needs nothing, so neither can it be troubled or hindered by
anything, if itself doth not trouble and hinder itself.

 What is εὐδαιμονία, or happiness: but ἀγαθὸς δαίμων, or, a good
dæmon, or spirit? What then dost thou do here, O opinion? By the Gods
I adjure thee, that thou get thee gone, as thou earnest: for I need thee
not. Thou earnest indeed unto me according to thy ancient wonted manner.
It is that, that all men have ever been subject unto. That thou camest
therefore I am not angry with thee, only begone, now that I have found
thee what thou art.

 Is any man so foolish as to fear change, to which all things that
once were not owe their being? And what is it, that is more pleasing and
more familiar to the nature of the universe? How couldst thou thyself
use thy ordinary hot baths, should not the wood that heateth them first
be changed? How couldst thou receive any nourishment from those things
that thou hast eaten, if they should not be changed? Can anything
else almost (that is useful and profitable) be brought to pass without
change? How then dost not thou perceive, that for thee also, by death,
to come to change, is a thing of the very same nature, and as necessary
for the nature of the universe?

 Through the substance of the universe, as through a torrent pass
all particular bodies, being all of the same nature, and all joint
workers with the universe itself as in one of our bodies so many
members among themselves. How many such as Chrysippus, how many such
as Socrates, how many such as Epictetus, hath the age of the world
long since swallowed up and devoured? Let this, be it either men or
businesses, that thou hast occasion to think of, to the end that thy
thoughts be not distracted and thy mind too earnestly set upon anything,
upon every such occasion presently come to thy mind. Of all my thoughts
and cares, one only thing shall be the object, that I myself do nothing
which to the proper constitution of man, (either in regard of the
thing itself, or in regard of the manner, or of the time of doing,)
is contrary. The time when thou shalt have forgotten all things, is
at hand. And that time also is at hand, when thou thyself shalt be
forgotten by all. Whilst thou art, apply thyself to that especially
which unto man as he is a mart, is most proper and agreeable, and that
is, for a man even to love them that transgress against him. This shall
be, if at the same time that any such thing doth happen, thou call
to mind, that they are thy kinsmen; that it is through ignorance and
against their wills that they sin; and that within a very short while
after, both thou and he shall be no more. But above all things, that he
hath not done thee any hurt; for that by him thy mind and understanding
is not made worse or more vile than it was before.

 The nature of the universe, of the common substance of all things
as it were of so much wax hath now perchance formed a horse; and then,
destroying that figure, hath new tempered and fashioned the matter of it
into the form and substance of a tree: then that again into the form and
substance of a man: and then that again into some other. Now every one
of these doth subsist but for a very little while. As for dissolution,
if it be no grievous thing to the chest or trunk, to be joined together;
why should it be more grievous to be put asunder?

 An angry countenance is much against nature, and it is oftentimes
the proper countenance of them that are at the point of death. But were
it so, that all anger and passion were so thoroughly quenched in thee,
that it were altogether impossible to kindle it any more, yet herein
must not thou rest satisfied, but further endeavour by good consequence
of true ratiocination, perfectly to conceive and understand, that all
anger and passion is against reason. For if thou shalt not be sensible
of thine innocence; if that also shall be gone from thee, the comfort of
a good conscience, that thou doest all things according to reason: what
shouldest thou live any longer for? All things that now thou seest,
are but for a moment. That nature, by which all things in the world are
administered, will soon bring change and alteration upon them, and then
of their substances make other things like unto them: and then soon
after others again of the matter and substance of these: that so by
these means, the world may still appear fresh and new.

 Whensoever any man doth trespass against other, presently consider
with thyself what it was that he did suppose to be good, what to be
evil, when he did trespass. For this when thou knowest, thou wilt pity
him thou wilt have no occasion either to wonder, or to be angry. For
either thou thyself dust yet live in that error and ignorance, as that
thou dust suppose either that very thing that he doth, or some other
like worldly thing, to be good; and so thou art bound to pardon him if
he have done that which thou in the like case wouldst have done thyself.
Or if so be that thou dost not any more suppose the same things to be
good or evil, that he doth; how canst thou but be gentle unto him that
is in an error?

 Fancy not to thyself things future, as though they were present
but of those that are present, take some aside, that thou takest most
benefit of, and consider of them particularly, how wonderfully thou
wouldst want them, if they were not present. But take heed withal, lest
that whilst thou dust settle thy contentment in things present, thou
grow in time so to overprize them, as that the want of them (whensoever
it shall so fall out) should be a trouble and a vexation unto thee. Wind
up thyself into thyself. Such is the nature of thy reasonable
commanding part, as that if it exercise justice, and have by that means
tranquillity within itself, it doth rest fully satisfied with itself
without any other thing.

 Wipe off all opinion stay the force and violence of unreasonable
lusts and affections: circumscribe the present time examine whatsoever
it be that is happened, either to thyself or to another: divide all
present objects, either in that which is formal or material think of the
last hour. That which thy neighbour hath committed, where the guilt of
it lieth, there let it rest. Examine in order whatsoever is spoken. Let
thy mind penetrate both into the effects, and into the causes. Rejoice
thyself with true simplicity, and modesty; and that all middle things
between virtue and vice are indifferent unto thee. Finally, love
mankind; obey God.

 All things (saith he) are by certain order and appointment. And
what if the elements only.

It will suffice to remember, that all things in general are by certain
order and appointment: or if it be but few. And as concerning death,
that either dispersion, or the atoms, or annihilation, or extinction,
or translation will ensue. And as concerning pain, that that which is
intolerable is soon ended by death; and that which holds long must needs
be tolerable; and that the mind in the meantime (which is all in all)
may by way of interclusion, or interception, by stopping all manner of
commerce and sympathy with the body, still retain its own tranquillity.
Thy understanding is not made worse by it. As for those parts that
suffer, let them, if they can, declare their grief themselves. As for
praise and commendation, view their mind and understanding, what estate
they are in; what kind of things they fly, and what things they seek
after: and that as in the seaside, whatsoever was before to be seen,
is by the continual succession of new heaps of sand cast up one upon
another, soon hid and covered; so in this life, all former things by
those which immediately succeed.

 Out of Plato. 'He then whose mind is endowed with true
magnanimity, who hath accustomed himself to the contemplation both of
all times, and of all things in general; can this mortal life (thinkest
thou) seem any great matter unto him? It is not possible, answered he.
Then neither will such a one account death a grievous thing? By no
means.'

 Out of Antisthenes. 'It is a princely thing to do well, and to be
ill-spoken of. It is a shameful thing that the face should be subject
unto the mind, to be put into what shape it will, and to be dressed by
it as it will; and that the mind should not bestow so much care upon
herself, as to fashion herself, and to dress herself as best becometh
her.'

 Out of several poets and comics. 'It will but little avail thee,
to turn thine anger and indignation upon the things themselves that have
fallen across unto thee. For as for them, they are not sensible of it,
&c. Thou shalt but make thyself a laughing-stock; both unto the Gods and
men, &c. Our life is reaped like a ripe ear of corn; one is yet
standing and another is down, &c. But if so be that I and my children be
neglected by the gods, there is some reason even for that, &c. As long
as right and equity is of my side, &c. Not to lament with them, not to
tremble, &c.'

 Out of Plato. 'My answer, full of justice and equity, should be
this: Thy speech is not right, O man! if thou supposest that he that is
of any worth at all, should apprehend either life or death, as a matter
of great hazard and danger; and should not make this rather his only
care, to examine his own actions, whether just or unjust: whether
actions of a good, or of a wicked man, &c. For thus in very truth stands
the case, O ye men of Athens. What place or station soever a man either
hath chosen to himself, judging it best for himself; or is by lawful
authority put and settled in, therein do I think (all appearance of
danger notwithstanding) that he should continue, as one who feareth
neither death, nor anything else, so much as he feareth to commit
anything that is vicious and shameful, &c. But, O noble sir, consider
I pray, whether true generosity and true happiness, do not consist in
somewhat else rather, than in the preservation either of our, or other
men's lives. For it is not the part of a man that is a man indeed, to
desire to live long or to make much of his life whilst he liveth: but
rather (he that is such) will in these things wholly refer himself unto
the Gods, and believing that which every woman can tell him, that no man
can escape death; the only thing that he takes thought and care for is
this, that what time he liveth, he may live as well and as virtuously
as he can possibly, &c. To look about, and with the eyes to follow the
course of the stars and planets as though thou wouldst run with them;
and to mind perpetually the several changes of the elements one into
another. For such fancies and imaginations, help much to purge away
the dross and filth of this our earthly life,' &c. That also is a fine
passage of Plato's, where he speaketh of worldly things in these words:
'Thou must also as from some higher place look down, as it were, upon
the things of this world, as flocks, armies, husbandmen's labours,
marriages, divorces, generations, deaths: the tumults of courts and
places of judicatures; desert places; the several nations of barbarians,
public festivals, mournings, fairs, markets.' How all things upon earth
are pell-mell; and how miraculously things contrary one to another,
concur to the beauty and perfection of this universe.

 To look back upon things of former ages, as upon the manifold
changes and conversions of several monarchies and commonwealths. We
may also foresee things future, for they shall all be of the same kind;
neither is it possible that they should leave the tune, or break the
concert that is now begun, as it were, by these things that are now done
and brought to pass in the world. It comes all to one therefore, whether
a man be a spectator of the things of this life but forty years, or
whether he see them ten thousand years together: for what shall he
see more? 'And as for those parts that came from the earth, they shall
return unto the earth again; and those that came from heaven, they
also shall return unto those heavenly places.' Whether it be a mere
dissolution and unbinding of the manifold intricacies and entanglements
of the confused atoms; or some such dispersion of the simple and
incorruptible elements... 'With meats and drinks and divers charms, they
seek to divert the channel, that they might not die. Yet must we needs
endure that blast of wind that cometh from above, though we toil and
labour never so much.'

 He hath a stronger body, and is a better wrestler than  What
then? Is he more bountiful? is he more modest? Doth he bear all adverse
chances with more equanimity: or with his neighbour's offences with more
meekness and gentleness than I?

 Where the matter may be effected agreeably to that reason, which
both unto the Gods and men is common, there can be no just cause of
grief or sorrow. For where the fruit and benefit of an action well begun
and prosecuted according to the proper constitution of man may be reaped
and obtained, or is sure and certain, it is against reason that any
damage should there be suspected. In all places, and at all times, it is
in thy power religiously to embrace whatsoever by God's appointment is
happened unto thee, and justly to converse with those men, whom thou
hast to do with, and accurately to examine every fancy that presents
itself, that nothing may slip and steal in, before thou hast rightly
apprehended the true nature of it.

 Look not about upon other men's minds and understandings; but look
right on forwards whither nature, both that of the universe, in those
things that happen unto thee; and thine in particular, in those things
that are done by thee: doth lead, and direct thee. Now every one is
bound to do that, which is consequent and agreeable to that end which
by his true natural constitution he was ordained unto. As for all other
things, they are ordained for the use of reasonable creatures: as in all
things we see that that which is worse and inferior, is made for
that which is better. Reasonable creatures, they are ordained one for
another. That therefore which is chief in every man's constitution, is,
that he intend the common good. The second is, that he yield not to any
lusts and motions of the flesh. For it is the part and privilege of the
reasonable and intellective faculty, that she can so bound herself,
as that neither the sensitive, nor the appetitive faculties, may not
anyways prevail upon her. For both these are brutish. And therefore over
both she challengeth mastery, and cannot anyways endure, if in her right
temper, to be subject unto either. And this indeed most justly. For
by nature she was ordained to command all in the body. The third
thing proper to man by his constitution, is, to avoid all rashness and
precipitancy; and not to be subject to error. To these things then, let
the mind apply herself and go straight on, without any distraction about
other things, and she hath her end, and by consequent her happiness.

 As one who had lived, and were now to die by right, whatsoever is
yet remaining, bestow that wholly as a gracious overplus upon a virtuous
life. Love and affect that only, whatsoever it be that happeneth, and is
by the fates appointed unto thee. For what can be more reasonable? And
as anything doth happen unto thee by way of cross, or calamity, call
to mind presently and set before thine eyes, the examples of some other
men, to whom the self-same thing did once happen likewise. Well, what
did they? They grieved; they wondered; they complained. And where are
they now? All dead and gone. Wilt thou also be like one of them?
Or rather leaving to men of the world (whose life both in regard of
themselves, and them that they converse with, is nothing but mere
mutability; or men of as fickle minds, as fickle bodies; ever changing
and soon changed themselves) let it be thine only care and study, how to
make a right use of all such accidents. For there is good use to be made
of them, and they will prove fit matter for thee to work upon, if it
shall be both thy care and thy desire, that whatsoever thou doest, thou
thyself mayst like and approve thyself for it. And both these, see,
that thou remember well, according as the diversity of the matter of
the action that thou art about shall require. Look within; within is the
fountain of all good. Such a fountain, where springing waters can never
fail, so thou dig still deeper and deeper.

 Thou must use thyself also to keep thy body fixed and steady;
free from all loose fluctuant either motion, or posture. And as upon thy
face and looks, thy mind hath easily power over them to keep them to
that which is grave and decent; so let it challenge the same power over
the whole body also. But so observe all things in this kind, as that it
be without any manner of affectation.

 The art of true living in this world is more like a wrestler's,
than a dancer's practice. For in this they both agree, to teach a man
whatsoever falls upon him, that he may be ready for it, and that nothing
may cast him down.

 Thou must continually ponder and consider with thyself, what
manner of men they be, and for their minds and understandings what is
their present estate, whose good word and testimony thou dost desire.
For then neither wilt thou see cause to complain of them that offend
against their wills; or find any want of their applause, if once
thou dost but penetrate into the true force and ground both of their
opinions, and of their desires. 'No soul (saith he) is willingly bereft
of the truth,' and by consequent, neither of justice, or temperance, or
kindness, and mildness; nor of anything that is of the same kind. It is
most needful that thou shouldst always remember this. For so shalt thou
be far more gentle and moderate towards all men.

 What pain soever thou art in, let this presently come to thy mind,
that it is not a thing whereof thou needest to be ashamed, neither is it
a thing whereby thy understanding, that hath the government of all,
can be made worse. For neither in regard of the substance of it, nor
in regard of the end of it (which is, to intend the common good) can
it alter and corrupt it. This also of Epicurus mayst thou in most pains
find some help of, that it is 'neither intolerable, nor eternal;' so
thou keep thyself to the true bounds and limits of reason and give not
way to opinion. This also thou must consider, that many things there be,
which oftentimes unsensibly trouble and vex thee, as not armed against
them with patience, because they go not ordinarily under the name of
pains, which in very deed are of the same nature as pain; as to slumber
unquietly, to suffer heat, to want appetite: when therefore any of these
things make thee discontented, check thyself with these words: Now hath
pain given thee the foil; thy courage hath failed thee.

 Take heed lest at any time thou stand so affected, though towards
unnatural evil men, as ordinary men are commonly one towards another.

 How know we whether Socrates were so eminent indeed, and of so
extraordinary a disposition? For that he died more gloriously, that he
disputed with the Sophists more subtilty; that he watched in the frost
more assiduously; that being commanded to fetch innocent Salaminius, he
refused to do it more generously; all this will not serve. Nor that he
walked in the streets, with much gravity and majesty, as was objected
unto him by his adversaries: which nevertheless a man may well doubt of,
whether it were so or no, or, which above all the rest, if so be that
it were true, a man would well consider of, whether commendable, or
dis-commendable. The thing therefore that we must inquire into, is this;
what manner of soul Socrates had: whether his disposition was such; as
that all that he stood upon, and sought after in this world, was barely
this, that he might ever carry himself justly towards men, and holily
towards the Gods. Neither vexing himself to no purpose at the wickedness
of others, nor yet ever condescending to any man's evil fact, or evil
intentions, through either fear, or engagement of friendship. Whether of
those things that happened unto him by God's appointment, he neither did
wonder at any when it did happen, or thought it intolerable in the trial
of it. And lastly, whether he never did suffer his mind to sympathise
with the senses, and affections of the body. For we must not think that
Nature hath so mixed and tempered it with the body, as that she hath not
power to circumscribe herself, and by herself to intend her own ends and
occasions.

 For it is a thing very possible, that a man should be a very
divine man, and yet be altogether unknown. This thou must ever be
mindful of, as of this also, that a man's true happiness doth consist
in very few things. And that although thou dost despair, that thou shalt
ever be a good either logician, or naturalist, yet thou art never the
further off by it from being either liberal, or modest, or charitable,
or obedient unto God.

 Free from all compulsion in all cheerfulness and alacrity thou
mayst run out thy time, though men should exclaim against thee never so
much, and the wild beasts should pull in sunder the poor members of thy
pampered mass of flesh. For what in either of these or the like cases
should hinder the mind to retain her own rest and tranquillity,
consisting both in the right judgment of those things that happen unto
her, and in the ready use of all present matters and occasions? So that
her judgment may say, to that which is befallen her by way of cross:
this thou art in very deed, and according to thy true nature:
notwithstanding that in the judgment of opinion thou dust appear
otherwise: and her discretion to the present object; thou art that,
which I sought for. For whatsoever it be, that is now present, shall
ever be embraced by me as a fit and seasonable object, both for my
reasonable faculty, and for my sociable, or charitable inclination to
work upon. And that which is principal in this matter, is that it may be
referred either unto the praise of God, or to the good of men. For
either unto God or man, whatsoever it is that doth happen in the world
hath in the ordinary course of nature its proper reference; neither is
there anything, that in regard of nature is either new, or reluctant and
intractable, but all things both usual and easy.

 Then hath a man attained to the estate of perfection in his life and
conversation, when he so spends every day, as if it were his last day:
never hot and vehement in his affections, nor yet so cold and stupid as
one that had no sense; and free from all manner of dissimulation.

 Can the Gods, who are immortal, for the continuance of so many ages
bear without indignation with such and so many sinners, as have ever
been, yea not only so, but also take such care for them, that they want
nothing; and dust thou so grievously take on, as one that could bear
with them no longer; thou that art but for a moment of time? yea thou
that art one of those sinners thyself? A very ridiculous thing it is,
that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which
is in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in
others, which is altogether impossible.

 What object soever, our reasonable and sociable faculty doth meet
with, that affords nothing either for the satisfaction of reason, or for
the practice of charity, she worthily doth think unworthy of herself.

 When thou hast done well, and another is benefited by thy action,
must thou like a very fool look for a third thing besides, as that
it may appear unto others also that thou hast done well, or that thou
mayest in time, receive one good turn for another? No man useth to be
weary of that which is beneficial unto him. But every action according
to nature, is beneficial. Be not weary then of doing that which is
beneficial unto thee, whilst it is so unto others.

 The nature of the universe did once certainly before it was
created, whatsoever it hath done since, deliberate and so resolve upon
the creation of the world. Now since that time, whatsoever it is, that
is and happens in the world, is either but a consequent of that one and
first deliberation: or if so be that this ruling rational part of the
world, takes any thought and care of things particular, they are surely
his reasonable and principal creatures, that are the proper object of
his particular care and providence. This often thought upon, will much
conduce to thy tranquillity.

 This also, among other things, may serve to keep thee from vainglory;
if thou shalt consider, that thou art now altogether incapable of the
commendation of one, who all his life long, or from his youth at least,
hath lived a philosopher's life. For both unto others, and to thyself
especially, it is well known, that thou hast done many things contrary
to that perfection of life. Thou hast therefore been confounded in thy
course, and henceforth it will be hard for thee to recover the title and
credit of a philosopher. And to it also is thy calling and profession
repugnant. If therefore thou dost truly understand, what it is that is
of moment indeed; as for thy fame and credit, take no thought or care
for that: let it suffice thee if all the rest of thy life, be it more or
less, thou shalt live as thy nature requireth, or according to the true
and natural end of thy making. Take pains therefore to know what it is
that thy nature requireth, and let nothing else distract thee. Thou
hast already had sufficient experience, that of those many things that
hitherto thou hast erred and wandered about, thou couldst not find
happiness in any of them. Not in syllogisms, and logical subtilties, not
in wealth, not in honour and reputation, not in pleasure. In none of all
these. Wherein then is it to be found? In the practice of those things,
which the nature of man, as he is a man, doth require. How then shall
he do those things? if his dogmata, or moral tenets and opinions (from
which all motions and actions do proceed), be right and true. Which be
those dogmata? Those that concern that which is good or evil, as that
there is nothing truly good and beneficial unto man, but that which
makes him just, temperate, courageous, liberal; and that there is
nothing truly evil and hurtful unto man, but that which causeth the
contrary effects.

 Upon every action that thou art about, put this question to thyself;
How will this when it is done agree with me? Shall I have no occasion
to repent of it? Yet a very little while and I am dead and gone; and
all things are at end. What then do I care for more than this, that my
present action whatsoever it be, may be the proper action of one that
is reasonable; whose end is, the common good; who in all things is ruled
and governed by the same law of right and reason, by which God Himself
is.

 Alexander, Caius, Pompeius; what are these to Diogenes, Heraclitus,
and Socrates? These penetrated into the true nature of things; into all
causes, and all subjects: and upon these did they exercise their power
and authority. But as for those, as the extent of their error was, so
far did their slavery extend.

 What they have done, they will still do, although thou shouldst hang
thyself. First; let it not trouble thee. For all things both good and
evil: come to pass according to the nature and general condition of the
universe, and within a very little while, all things will be at an
end; no man will be remembered: as now of Africanus (for example) and
Augustus it is already come to pass. Then secondly; fix thy mind upon
the thing itself; look into it, and remembering thyself, that thou art
bound nevertheless to be a good man, and what it is that thy nature
requireth of thee as thou art a man, be not diverted from what thou art
about, and speak that which seemeth unto thee most just: only speak it
kindly, modestly, and without hypocrisy.

 That which the nature of the universe doth busy herself about, is;
that which is here, to transfer it thither, to change it, and thence
again to take it away, and to carry it to another place. So that thou
needest not fear any new thing. For all things are usual and ordinary;
and all things are disposed by equality.

 Every particular nature hath content, when in its own proper course
it speeds. A reasonable nature doth then speed, when first in matter of
fancies and imaginations, it gives no consent to that which is either
false uncertain. Secondly, when in all its motions and resolutions it
takes its level at the common good only, and that it desireth nothing,
and flieth from nothing, bet what is in its own power to compass or
avoid. And lastly, when it willingly and gladly embraceth, whatsoever is
dealt and appointed unto it by the common nature. For it is part of it;
even as the nature of any one leaf, is part of the common nature of all
plants and trees. But that the nature of a leaf, is part of a nature
both unreasonable and unsensible, and which in its proper end may be
hindered; or, which is servile and slavish: whereas the nature of man is
part of a common nature which cannot be hindered, and which is both
reasonable and just. From whence also it is, that according to the
worth of everything, she doth make such equal distribution of all
things, as of duration, substance form, operation, and of events and
accidents. But herein consider not whether thou shalt find this equality
in everything absolutely and by itself; but whether in all the
particulars of some one thing taken together, and compared with all the
particulars of some other thing, and them together likewise.

 Thou hast no time nor opportunity to read. What then? Hast thou
not time and opportunity to exercise thyself, not to wrong thyself; to
strive against all carnal pleasures and pains, and to get the upper hand
of them; to contemn honour and vainglory; and not only, not to be angry
with them, whom towards thee thou doest find unsensible and unthankful;
but also to have a care of them still, and of their welfare?

 Forbear henceforth to complain of the trouble of a courtly life,
either in public before others, or in private by thyself.

 Repentance is an inward and self-reprehension for the neglect or
omission of somewhat that was profitable. Now whatsoever is good, is
also profitable, and it is the part of an honest virtuous man to set by
it, and to make reckoning of it accordingly. But never did any honest
virtuous man repent of the neglect or omission of any carnal pleasure:
no carnal pleasure then is either good or profitable.

 This, what is it in itself, and by itself, according to its proper
constitution? What is the substance of it? What is the matter, or proper
use? What is the form or efficient cause? What is it for in this world,
and how long will it abide? Thus must thou examine all things, that
present themselves unto thee.

 When thou art hard to be stirred up and awaked out of thy sleep,
admonish thyself and call to mind, that, to perform actions tending to
the common good is that which thine own proper constitution, and
that which the nature of man do require. But to sleep, is common to
unreasonable creatures also. And what more proper and natural, yea what
more kind and pleasing, than that which is according to nature?

 As every fancy and imagination presents itself unto thee, consider
(if it be possible) the true nature, and the proper qualities of it, and
reason with thyself about it.

 At thy first encounter with any one, say presently to thyself:
This man, what are his opinions concerning that which is good or evil?
as concerning pain, pleasure, and the causes of both; concerning honour,
and dishonour, concerning life and death? thus and thus. Now if it be
no wonder that a man should have such and such opinions, how can it be
a wonder that he should do such and such things? I will remember then,
that he cannot but do as he doth, holding those opinions that he doth.
Remember, that as it is a shame for any man to wonder that a fig tree
should bear figs, so also to wonder that the world should bear anything,
whatsoever it is which in the ordinary course of nature it may bear.
To a physician also and to a pilot it is a shame either for the one to
wonder, that such and such a one should have an ague; or for the other,
that the winds should prove Contrary.

 Remember, that to change thy mind upon occasion, and to follow him
that is able to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at
the first, what is right and just, without help. For of thee nothing is
required, ti, is beyond the extent of thine own deliberation and jun.
merit, and of thine own understanding.

 If it were thine act and in thine own power, wouldest thou do
it? If it were not, whom dost tin accuse? the atoms, or the Gods? For to
do either, the part of a mad man. Thou must therefore blame nobody, but
if it be in thy power, redress what is amiss; if it be not, to what end
is it to complain? For nothing should be done but to some certain end.

 Whatsoever dieth and falleth, however and wheresoever it die
and fall, it cannot fall out of the world, here it have its abode
and change, here also shall it have its dissolution into its proper
elements. The same are the world's elements, and the elements of which
thou dost consist. And they when they are changed, they murmur not; why
shouldest thou?

 Whatsoever is, was made for something: as a horse, a vine. Why
wonderest thou? The sun itself will say of itself, I was made for
something; and so hath every god its proper function. What then were
then made for? to disport and delight thyself? See how even common sense
and reason cannot brook it.

 Nature hath its end as well in the end and final consummation of
anything that is, as in the begin-nine and continuation of it.

 As one that tosseth up a ball. And what is a ball the better, if
the motion of it be upwards; or the worse if it be downwards; or if it
chance to fall upon the ground? So for the bubble; if it continue, what
it the better? and if it dissolve, what is it the worse And so is it of
a candle too. And so must thou reason with thyself, both in matter of
fame, and in matter of death. For as for the body itself, (the subject
of death) wouldest thou know the vileness of it? Turn it about that
thou mayest behold it the worst sides upwards as well, as in its more
ordinary pleasant shape; how doth it look, when it is old and withered?
when sick and pained? when in the act of lust, and fornication? And
as for fame. This life is short. Both he that praiseth, and he that is
praised; he that remembers, and he that is remembered, will soon be dust
and ashes. Besides, it is but in one corner of this part of the world
that thou art praised; and yet in this corner, thou hast not the joint
praises of all men; no nor scarce of any one constantly. And yet the
whole earth itself, what is it but as one point, in regard of the whole
world?

 That which must be the subject of thy consideration, is either the
matter itself, or the dogma, or the operation, or the true sense and
signification.

 Most justly have these things happened unto thee: why dost not
thou amend? O but thou hadst rather become good to-morrow, than to be
so to-day.

 Shall I do it? I will; so the end of my action be to do good unto
men. Doth anything by way of cross or adversity happen unto me? I accept
it, with reference unto the Gods, and their providence; the fountain of
all things, from which whatsoever comes to pass, doth hang and depend.

 By one action judge of the rest: this bathing which usually takes
up so much of our time, what is it? Oil, sweat, filth; or the sordes of
the body: an excrementitious viscosity, the excrements of oil and other
ointments used about the body, and mixed with the sordes of the body:
all base and loathsome. And such almost is every part of our life;
and every worldly object.

 Lucilla buried Verus; then was Lucilla herself buried by others.
So Secunda Maximus, then Secunda herself. So Epitynchanus, Diotimus;
then Epitynchanus himself. So Antoninus Pius, Faustina his wife; then
Antoninus himself. This is the course of the world. First Celer,
Adrianus; then Adrianus himself. And those austere ones; those that
foretold other men's deaths; those that were so proud and stately, where
are they now? Those austere ones I mean, such as were Charax, and
Demetrius the Platonic, and Eudaemon, and others like unto those. They
were all but for one day; all dead and gone long since. Some of them no
sooner dead, than forgotten. Others soon turned into fables. Of others,
even that which was fabulous, is now long since forgotten. This
thereafter thou must remember, that whatsoever thou art compounded of,
shall soon be dispersed, and that thy life and breath, or thy soul,
shall either be no more or shall ranslated (sp.), and appointed to some
certain place and station.

 The true joy of a man, is to do that which properly belongs unto a
man. That which is most proper unto a man, is, first, to be kindly
affected towards them that are of the same kind and nature as he is
himself to contemn all sensual motions and appetites, to discern rightly
all plausible fancies and imaginations, to contemplate the nature of the
universe; both it, and things that are done in it. In which kind of
contemplation three several relations are to be observed The first, to
the apparent secondary cause. The Second to the first original cause,
God, from whom originally proceeds whatsoever doth happen in the world.
The third and last, to them that we live and converse with: what use may
be made of it, to their use and benefit.

 If pain be an evil, either it is in regard of the body; (and that
cannot be, because the body of itself is altogether insensible:) or in
regard of the soul But it is in the power of the soul, to preserve her
own peace and tranquillity, and not to suppose that pain is evil. For
all judgment and deliberation; all prosecution, or aversation is from
within, whither the sense of evil (except it be let in by opinion)
cannot penetrate.

 Wipe off all idle fancies, and say unto thyself incessantly; Now
if I will, it is in my power to keep out of this my soul all wickedness,
all lust, and concupiscences, all trouble and confusion. But on the
contrary to behold and consider all things according to their true
nature, and to carry myself towards everything according to its true
worth. Remember then this thy power that nature hath given thee.

 Whether thou speak in the Senate or whether thou speak to any
particular, let thy speech In always grave and modest. But thou must
not openly and vulgarly observe that sound and exact form of speaking,
concerning that which is truly good and truly civil; the vanity of
the world, and of worldly men: which otherwise truth and reason doth
prescribe.

 Augustus his court; his wife, his daughter, his nephews, his
sons-in-law his sister, Agrippa, his kinsmen, his domestics, his
friends; Areus, Mæcenas, his slayers of beasts for sacrifice and
divination: there thou hast the death of a whole court together. Proceed
now on to the rest that have been since that of Augustus. Hath death
dwelt with them otherwise, though so many and so stately whilst they
lived, than it doth use to deal with any one particular man? Consider
now the death of a whole kindred and family, as of that of the Pompeys,
as that also that useth to be written upon some monuments, HE WAS THE
LAST OF HIS OWN KINDRED. O what care did his predecessors take, that
they might leave a successor, yet behold at last one or other must of
necessity be THE LAST. Here again therefore consider the death of a
whole kindred.

 Contract thy whole life to the measure and proportion of one single
action. And if in every particular action thou dost perform what is
fitting to the utmost of thy power, let it suffice thee. And who can
hinder thee, but that thou mayest perform what is fitting? But there may
be some outward let and impediment. Not any, that can hinder thee, but
that whatsoever thou dost, thou may do it, justly, temperately, and
with the praise of God. Yea, but there may be somewhat, whereby some
operation or other of thine may be hindered. And then, with that very
thing that doth hinder, thou mayest he well pleased, and so by this
gentle and equanimious conversion of thy mind unto that which may be,
instead of that which at first thou didst intend, in the room of that
former action there succeedeth another, which agrees as well with this
contraction of thy life, that we now speak of.

 Receive temporal blessings without ostentation, when they are sent
and thou shalt be able to part with them with all readiness and facility
when they are taken from thee again.

 If ever thou sawest either a hand, or a foot, or a head lying by
itself, in some place or other, as cut off from the rest of the body,
such must thou conceive him to make himself, as much as in him lieth,
that either is offended with anything that is happened, (whatsoever it
be) and as it were divides himself from it: or that commits anything
against the natural law of mutual correspondence, and society among men:
or, he that, commits any act of uncharitableness. Whosoever thou art,
thou art such, thou art cast forth I know not whither out of the general
unity, which is according to nature. Thou went born indeed a part, but
now thou hast cut thyself off. However, herein is matter of joy and
exultation, that thou mayst be united again. God hath not granted
it unto any other part, that once separated and cut off, it might be
reunited, and come together again. But, behold, that GOODNESS how great
and immense it is! which hath so much esteemed MAN. As at first he
was so made, that he needed not, except he would himself, have divided
himself from the whole; so once divided and cut off, IT hath so provided
and ordered it, that if he would himself, he might return, and grow
together again, and be admitted into its former rank and place of a
part, as he was before.

 As almost all her other faculties and properties the nature of
the universe hath imparted unto every reasonable creature, so this in
particular we have received from her, that as whatsoever doth oppose
itself unto her, and doth withstand her in her purposes and intentions,
she doth, though against its will and intention, bring it about to
herself, to serve herself of it in the execution of her own destinated
ends; and so by this though not intended co-operation of it with herself
makes it part of herself whether it will or no. So may every reasonable
creature, what crosses and impediments soever it meets with in the
course of this mortal life, it may use them as fit and proper objects,
to the furtherance of whatsoever it intended and absolutely proposed
unto itself as its natural end and happiness.

 Let not the general representation unto thyself of the
wretchedness of this our mortal life, trouble thee. Let not thy mind
wander up and down, and heap together in her thoughts the many troubles
and grievous calamities which thou art as subject unto as any other. But
as everything in particular doth happen, put this question unto thyself,
and say: What is it that in this present matter, seems unto thee so
intolerable? For thou wilt be ashamed to confess it. Then upon this
presently call to mind, that neither that which is future, nor that
which is past can hurt thee; but that only which is present. (And that
also is much lessened, if thou dost lightly circumscribe it:) and then
check thy mind if for so little a while, (a mere instant), it cannot
hold out with patience.

 What? are either Panthea or Pergamus abiding to this day by their
masters' tombs? or either Chabrias or Diotimus by that of Adrianus? O
foolery! For what if they did, would their masters be sensible of It? or
if sensible, would they be glad of it? or if glad, were these immortal?
Was not it appointed unto them also (both men and women,) to become
old in time, and then to die? And these once dead, what would become of
these former? And when all is done, what is all this for, but for a mere
bag of blood and corruption?

 If thou beest quick-sighted, be so in matter of judgment, and
best discretion, saith he.

 In the whole constitution of man, I see not any virtue contrary
to justice, whereby it may be resisted and opposed. But one whereby
pleasure and voluptuousness may be resisted and opposed, I see:
continence.

 If thou canst but withdraw conceit and opinion concerning that
which may seem hurtful and offensive, thou thyself art as safe, as safe
may be. Thou thyself? and who is that? Thy reason. 'Yea, but I am not
reason.' Well, be it so. However, let not thy reason or understanding
admit of grief, and if there be anything in thee that is grieved, let
that, (whatsoever it be,) conceive its own grief, if it can.

 That which is a hindrance of the senses, is an evil to the
sensitive nature. That which is a hindrance of the appetitive and
prosecutive faculty, is an evil to the sensitive nature. As of the
sensitive, so of the vegetative constitution, whatsoever is a hindrance
unto it, is also in that respect an evil unto the same. And so likewise,
whatsoever is a hindrance unto the mind and understanding, must needs
be the proper evil of the reasonable nature. Now apply all those things
unto thyself. Do either pain or pleasure seize on thee? Let the senses
look to that. Hast thou met with Some obstacle or other in thy purpose
and intention? If thou didst propose without due reservation and
exception now hath thy reasonable part received a blow indeed But if in
general thou didst propose unto thyself what soever might be, thou art
not thereby either hurt, nor properly hindered. For in those things that
properly belong unto the mind, she cannot be hindered by any man. It
is not fire, nor iron; nor the power of a tyrant nor the power of a
slandering tongue; nor anything else that can penetrate into her.

 If once round and solid, there is no fear that ever it will change.

 Why should I grieve myself; who never did willingly grieve any
other! One thing rejoices one and another thing another. As for me, this
is my joy, if my understanding be right and sound, as neither averse
from any man, nor refusing any of those things which as a man I am
subject unto; if I can look upon all things in the world meekly and
kindly; accept all things and carry myself towards everything according
to to true worth of the thing itself.

 This time that is now present, bestow thou upon thyself. They that
rather hunt for fame after death, do not consider, that those men that
shall be hereafter, will be even such, as these whom now they can so
hardly bear with. And besides they also will be mortal men. But to
consider the thing in itself, if so many with so many voices, shall make
such and such a sound, or shall have such and such an opinion concerning
thee, what is it to thee?

 Take me and throw me where thou wilt: I am indifferent. For there
also I shall have that spirit which is within me propitious; that is
well pleased and fully contented both in that constant disposition, and
with those particular actions, which to its own proper constitution are
suitable and agreeable.

 Is this then a thing of that worth, that for it my soul should
suffer, and become worse than it was? as either basely dejected, or
disordinately affected, or confounded within itself, or terrified? What
can there be, that thou shouldest so much esteem?

 Nothing can happen unto thee, which is not incidental unto thee, as
thou art a man. As nothing can happen either to an ox, a vine, or to
a stone, which is not incidental unto them; unto every one in his own
kind. If therefore nothing can happen unto anything, which is not both
usual and natural; why art thou displeased? Sure the common nature
of all would not bring anything upon any, that were intolerable. If
therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is
not that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion
concerning the thing: which thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt.
But if it be somewhat that is amiss in thine own disposition, that doth
grieve thee, mayest thou not rectify thy moral tenets and opinions. But
if it grieve thee, that thou doest not perform that which seemeth unto
thee right and just, why doest not thou choose rather to perform it than
to grieve? But somewhat that is stronger than thyself doth hinder thee.
Let it not grieve thee then, if it be not thy fault that the thing is
not performed. 'Yea but it is a thing of that nature, as that thy life
is not worth the while, except it may be performed.' If it be so, upon
condition that thou be kindly and lovingly disposed towards all men,
thou mayest be gone. For even then, as much as at any time, art thou in
a very good estate of performance, when thou doest die in charity with
those, that are an obstacle unto thy performance.

 Remember that thy mind is of that nature as that it becometh
altogether unconquerable, when once recollected in herself, she seeks no
other content than this, that she cannot be forced: yea though it so
fall out, that it be even against reason itself, that it cloth bandy.
How much less when by the help of reason she is able to judge of things
with discretion? And therefore let thy chief fort and place of defence
be, a mind free from passions. A stronger place, (whereunto to make his
refuge, and so to become impregnable) and better fortified than this,
hath no man. He that seeth not this is unlearned. He that seeth it, and
betaketh not himself to this place of refuge, is unhappy.

 Keep thyself to the first bare and naked apprehensions of things,
as they present themselves unto thee, and add not unto them. It is
reported unto thee, that such a one speaketh ill of thee. Well; that he
speaketh ill of thee, so much is reported. But that thou art hurt
thereby, is not reported: that is the addition of opinion, which thou
must exclude. I see that my child is sick. That he is sick, I see, but
that he is in danger of his life also, I see it not. Thus thou must use
to keep thyself to the first motions and apprehensions of things, as
they present themselves outwardly; and add not unto them from within
thyself through mere conceit and opinion. Or rather add unto them: hut
as one that understandeth the true nature of all things that happen in
the world.

 Is the cucumber bitter? set it away. Brambles are in the way?
avoid them. Let this suffice. Add not presently speaking unto thyself,
What serve these things for in the world? For, this, one that is
acquainted with the mysteries of nature, will laugh at thee for it; as a
carpenter would or a shoemaker, if meeting in either of their shops with
some shavings, or small remnants of their work, thou shouldest blame
them for it. And yet those men, it is not for want of a place where to
throw them that they keep them in their shops for a while: but the
nature of the universe hath no such out-place; but herein doth consist
the wonder of her art and skill, that she having once circumscribed
herself within some certain bounds and limits, whatsoever is within her
that seems either corrupted, or old, or unprofitable, she can change it
into herself, and of these very things can make new things; so that she
needeth not to seek elsewhere out of herself either for a new supply of
matter and substance, or for a place where to throw out whatsoever is
irrecoverably putrid and corrupt. Thus she, as for place, so for matter
and art, is herself sufficient unto herself.

 Not to be slack and negligent; or loose, and wanton in thy
actions; nor contentious, and troublesome in thy conversation; nor to
rove and wander in thy fancies and imaginations. Not basely to contract
thy soul; nor boisterously to sally out with it, or furiously to launch
out as it were, nor ever to want employment.

 'They kill me, they cut my flesh; they persecute my person with
curses.' What then? May not thy mind for all this continue pure,
prudent, temperate, just? As a fountain of sweet and clear water, though
she be cursed by some stander by, yet do her springs nevertheless still
run as sweet and clear as before; yea though either dirt or dung be
thrown in, yet is it no sooner thrown, than dispersed, and she cleared.
She cannot be dyed or infected by it. What then must I do, that I
may have within myself an overflowing fountain, and not a well? Beget
thyself by continual pains and endeavours to true liberty with charity,
and true simplicity and modesty.

 He that knoweth not what the world is, knoweth not where he himself
is. And he that knoweth not what the world was made for, cannot possibly
know either what are the qualities, or what is the nature of the world.
Now he that in either of these is to seek, for what he himself was made
is ignorant also. What then dost thou think of that man, who proposeth
unto himself, as a matter of great moment, the noise and applause
of men, who both where they are, and what they are themselves, are
altogether ignorant? Dost thou desire to be commended of that man, who
thrice in one hour perchance, doth himself curse himself? Dost thou
desire to please him, who pleaseth not himself? or dost thou think that
he pleaseth himself, who doth use to repent himself almost of everything
that he doth?

 Not only now henceforth to have a common breath, or to hold
correspondency of breath, with that air, that compasseth us about; but
to have a common mind, or to hold correspondency of mind also with that
rational substance, which compasseth all things. For, that also is of
itself, and of its own nature (if a man can but draw it in as he should)
everywhere diffused; and passeth through all things, no less than the
air doth, if a man can but suck it in.

 Wickedness in general doth not hurt the world. Particular
wickedness doth not hurt any other: only unto him it is hurtful,
whosoever he be that offends, unto whom in great favour and mercy it is
granted, that whensoever he himself shall but first desire it, he may be
presently delivered of it. Unto my free-will my neighbour's free-will,
whoever he be, (as his life, or his bode), is altogether indifferent.
For though we are all made one for another, yet have our minds and
understandings each of them their own proper and limited jurisdiction.
For else another man's wickedness might be my evil which God would not
have, that it might not be in another man's power to make me unhappy:
which nothing now can do but mine own wickedness.

 The sun seemeth to be shed abroad. And indeed it is diffused but
not effused. For that diffusion of it is a τάσις or an extension. For
therefore are the beams of it called ἀκτῖνες from the word ἐκτείνεσθαι
to be stretched out and extended. Now what a sunbeam is, thou mayest
know if thou observe the light of the sun, when through some narrow
hole it pierceth into some room that is dark. For it is always in a
direct line. And as by any solid body, that it meets with in the way
that is not penetrable by air, it is divided and abrupted, and yet
neither slides off, or falls down, but stayeth there nevertheless: such
must the diffusion in the mind be; not an effusion, but an extension.
What obstacles and impediments soever she meeteth within her way, she
must not violently, and by way of an impetuous onset light upon them;
neither must she fall down; but she must stand, and give light unto
that which doth admit of it. For as for that which doth not, it is its
own fault and loss, if it bereave itself of her light.

 He that feareth death, either feareth that he shall have no sense at
all, or that his senses will not be the same. Whereas, he should rather
comfort himself, that either no sense at all, and so no sense of evil;
or if any sense, then another life, and so no death properly.

 All men are made one for another: either then teach them better, or
bear with them.

 The motion of the mind is not as the motion of a dart. For
the mind when it is wary and cautelous, and by way of diligent
circumspection turneth herself many ways, may then as well be said to
go straight on to the object, as when it useth no such circumspection.


 To pierce and penetrate into the estate of every one's
understanding that thou hast to do with: as also to make the estate of
thine own open, and penetrable to any other.

 He that is unjust, is also impious. For the nature of the universe,
having made all reasonable creatures one for another, to the end that
they should do one another good; more or less according to the several
persons and occasions but in nowise hurt one another: it is manifest
that he that doth transgress against this her will, is guilty of impiety
towards the most ancient and venerable of all the deities. For the
nature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, and
therefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which
now is, to whatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation
of blood and kindred. She is also called truth and is the first cause
of all truths. He therefore that willingly and wittingly doth lie, is
impious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he that
against his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe,
and in that striving with the nature of the world he doth in his
particular, violate the general order of the world. For he doth no
better than strive and war against it, who contrary to his own nature
applieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had
before furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the
attainment of it; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able
to discern that which is false from that which is true. He also that
pursues after pleasures, as that which is truly good and flies from
pains, as that which is truly evil: is impious. For such a one must of
necessity oftentimes accuse that common nature, as distributing many
things both unto the evil, and unto the good, not according to the
deserts of either: as unto the bad oftentimes pleasures, and the causes
of pleasures; so unto the good, pains, and the occasions of pains.
Again, he that feareth pains and crosses in this world, feareth some of
those things which some time or other must needs happen in the world.
And that we have already showed to be impious. And he that pursueth
after pleasures, will not spare, to compass his desires, to do that
which is unjust, and that is manifestly impious. Now those things which
unto nature are equally indifferent (for she had not created both, both
pain and pleasure, if both had not been unto her equally indifferent):
they that will live according to nature, must in those things (as being
of the same mind and disposition that she is) be as equally indifferent.
Whosoever therefore in either matter of pleasure and pain; death and
life; honour and dishonour, (which things nature in the administration
of the world, indifferently doth make use of), is not as indifferent,
it is apparent that he is impious. When I say that common nature
doth indifferently make use of them, my meaning is, that they happen
indifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary
consequence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the
world, according to that first and ancient deliberation of Providence,
by which she from some certain beginning, did resolve upon the creation
of such a world, conceiving then in her womb as it were some certain
rational generative seeds and faculties of things future, whether
subjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many.

 It were indeed more happy and comfortable, for a man to depart out
of this world, having lived all his life long clear from all falsehood,
dissimulation, voluptuousness, and pride. But if this cannot be, yet it
is some comfort for a man joyfully to depart as weary, and out of love
with those; rather than to desire to live, and to continue long in those
wicked courses. Hath not yet experience taught thee to fly from the
plague? For a far greater plague is the corruption of the mind, than any
certain change and distemper of the common air can be. This is a plague
of creatures, as they are living creatures; but that of men as they are
men or reasonable.

 Thou must not in matter of death carry thyself scornfully, but as
one that is well pleased with it, as being one of those things that
nature hath appointed. For what thou dost conceive of these, of a boy to
become a young man, to wax old, to grow, to ripen, to get teeth, or a
beard, or grey hairs to beget, to bear, or to be delivered; or what
other action soever it be, that is natural unto man according to the
several seasons of his life; such a thing is it also to be dissolved. It
is therefore the part of a wise man, in matter of death, not in any wise
to carry himself either violently, or proudly but patiently to wait for
it, as one of nature's operations: that with the same mind as now thou
dost expect when that which yet is but an embryo in thy wife's belly
shall come forth, thou mayst expect also when thy soul shall fall off
from that outward coat or skin: wherein as a child in the belly it lieth
involved and shut up. But thou desirest a more popular, and though not
so direct and philosophical, yet a very powerful and penetrative recipe
against the fear of death, nothing can make they more willing to part
with thy life, than if thou shalt consider, both what the subjects
themselves are that thou shalt part with, and what manner of disposition
thou shalt no more have to do with. True it is, that, offended with them
thou must not be by no means, but take care of them, and meekly bear
with them However, this thou mayst remember, that whensoever it happens
that thou depart, it shall not be from men that held the same opinions
that thou dost. For that indeed, (if it were so) is the only thing that
might make thee averse from death, and willing to continue here, if it
were thy hap to live with men that had obtained the same belief that
thou hast. But now, what a toil it is for thee to live with men of
different opinions, thou seest: so that thou hast rather occasion to
say, Hasten, I thee pray, O Death; lest I also in time forget myself.

 He that sinneth, sinneth unto himself. He that is unjust, hurts
himself, in that he makes himself worse than he was before. Not he only
that committeth, but he also that omitteth something, is oftentimes
unjust.

 If my present apprehension of the object be right, and my present
action charitable, and this, towards whatsoever doth proceed from God,
be my present disposition, to be well pleased with it, it sufficeth.

 To wipe away fancy, to use deliberation, to quench concupiscence, to
keep the mind free to herself.

 Of all unreasonable creatures, there is but one unreasonable soul;
and of all that are reasonable, but one reasonable soul, divided betwixt
them all. As of all earthly things there is but one earth, and but one
light that we see by; and but one air that we breathe in, as many as
either breathe or see. Now whatsoever partakes of some common thing,
naturally affects and inclines unto that whereof it is part, being of
one kind and nature with it. Whatsoever is earthly, presseth downwards
to the common earth. Whatsoever is liquid, would flow together. And
whatsoever is airy, would be together likewise. So that without some
obstacle, and some kind of violence, they cannot well be kept asunder.
Whatsoever is fiery, doth not only by reason of the elementary fire tend
upwards; but here also is so ready to join, and to burn together, that
whatsoever doth want sufficient moisture to make resistance, is easily
set on fire. Whatsoever therefore is partaker of that reasonable common
nature, naturally doth as much and more long after his own kind. For by
how much in its own nature it excels all other things, by so much more
is it desirous to be joined and united unto that, which is of its own
nature. As for unreasonable creatures then, they had not long been, but
presently begun among them swarms, and flocks, and broods of young ones,
and a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable,
yet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of
union more strong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more
excellent nature, than either in plants, or stones, or trees. But among
reasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, friendships, families, public
meetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truces. Now among
them that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the stars and planets,
though by their nature far distant one from another, yet even among them
began some mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to
excellency in a high degree to affect unity, as that even in things so
far distant, it could operate unto a mutual sympathy. But now behold,
what is now come to pass. Those creatures that are reasonable, are now
the only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and
inclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things
that are of one kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to
flow together. But though they fly from nature, yet are they stopt in
their course, and apprehended. Do they what they can, nature doth
prevail. And so shalt thou confess, if thou dost observe it. For sooner
mayst thou find a thing earthly, where no earthly thing is, than find a
man that naturally can live by himself alone.

 Man, God, the world, every one in their kind, bear some fruits.
All things have their proper time to bear. Though by custom, the word
itself is in a manner become proper unto the vine, and the like, yet is
it so nevertheless, as we have said. As for reason, that beareth both
common fruit for the use of others; and peculiar, which itself doth
enjoy. Reason is of a diffusive nature, what itself is in itself, it
begets in others, and so doth multiply.

 Either teach them better if it be in thy power; or if it be not,
remember that for this use, to bear with them patiently, was mildness
and goodness granted unto thee. The Gods themselves are good unto such;
yea and in some things, (as in matter of health, of wealth, of honour,)
are content often to further their endeavours: so good and gracious are
they. And mightest thou not be so too? or, tell me, what doth hinder
thee?

 Labour not as one to whom it is appointed to be wretched, nor as one
that either would be pitied, or admired; but let this be thine only care
and desire; so always and in all things to prosecute or to forbear, as
the law of charity, or mutual society doth require.

 This day I did come out of all my trouble. Nay I have cast out all
my trouble; it should rather be for that which troubled thee, whatsoever
it was, was not without anywhere that thou shouldest come out of it, but
within in thine own opinions, from whence it must be cast out, before
thou canst truly and constantly be at ease.

 All those things, for matter of experience are usual and ordinary;
for their continuance but for a day; and for their matter, most base and
filthy. As they were in the days of those whom we have buried, so are
they now also, and no otherwise.

 The things themselves that affect us, they stand without doors,
neither knowing anything themselves nor able to utter anything unto
others concerning themselves. What then is it, that passeth verdict on
them? The understanding.

 As virtue and wickedness consist not in passion, but in action; so
neither doth the true good or evil of a reasonable charitable man
consist in passion, but in operation and action.

 To the stone that is cast up, when it comes down it is no hurt unto
it; as neither benefit, when it doth ascend.

 Sift their minds and understandings, and behold what men they be,
whom thou dost stand in fear of what they shall judge of thee, what they
themselves judge of themselves.

 All things that are in the world, are always in the estate
of alteration. Thou also art in a perpetual change, yea and under
corruption too, in some part: and so is the whole world.

 it is not thine, but another man's sin. Why should it trouble
thee? Let him look to it, whose sin it is.

 Of an operation and of a purpose there is an ending, or of an
action and of a purpose we say commonly, that it is at an end: from
opinion also there is an absolute cessation, which is as it were the
death of it. In all this there is no hurt. Apply this now to a man's
age, as first, a child; then a youth, then a young man, then an old man;
every change from one age to another is a kind of death And all this
while here no matter of grief yet. Pass now unto that life first, that
which thou livedst under thy grandfather, then under thy mother, then
under thy father. And thus when through the whole course of thy life
hitherto thou hast found and observed many alterations, many changes,
many kinds of endings and cessations, put this question to thyself What
matter of grief or sorrow dost thou find in any of these? Or what doest
thou suffer through any of these? If in none of these, then neither
in the ending and consummation of thy whole life, which is also but a
cessation and change.

 As occasion shall require, either to thine own understanding, or to
that of the universe, or to his, whom thou hast now to do with, let thy
refuge be with all speed. To thine own, that it resolve upon nothing
against justice. To that of the universe, that thou mayest remember,
part of whom thou art. Of his, that thou mayest consider whether in the
estate of ignorance, or of knowledge. And then also must thou call to
mind, that he is thy kinsman.

 As thou thyself, whoever thou art, were made for the perfection and
consummation, being a member of it, of a common society; so must every
action of thine tend to the perfection and consummation of a life that
is truly sociable. What action soever of thine therefore that either
immediately or afar off, hath not reference to the common good, that is
an exorbitant and disorderly action; yea it is seditious; as one among
the people who from such and such a consent and unity, should factiously
divide and separate himself.

 Children's anger, mere babels; wretched souls bearing up dead
bodies, that they may not have their fall so soon: even as it is in that
common dirge song.

 Go to the quality of the cause from which the effect doth
proceed. Behold it by itself bare and naked, separated from all that is
material. Then consider the utmost bounds of time that that cause, thus
and thus qualified, can subsist and abide.

 Infinite are the troubles and miseries, that thou hast already
been put to, by reason of this only, because that for all happiness
it did not suffice thee, or, that thou didst not account it sufficient
happiness, that thy understanding did operate according to its natural
constitution.

 When any shall either impeach thee with false accusations, or
hatefully reproach thee, or shall use any such carriage towards thee,
get thee presently to their minds and understandings, and look in them,
and behold what manner of men they be. Thou shalt see, that there is no
such occasion why it should trouble thee, what such as they are think of
thee. Yet must thou love them still, for by nature they are thy friends.
And the Gods themselves, in those things that they seek from them as
matters of great moment, are well content, all manner of ways, as by
dreams and oracles, to help them as well as others.

 Up and down, from one age to another, go the ordinary things of
the world; being still the same. And either of everything in particular
before it come to pass, the mind of the universe doth consider with
itself and deliberate: and if so, then submit for shame unto the
determination of such an excellent understanding: or once for all it did
resolve upon all things in general; and since that whatsoever happens,
happens by a necessary consequence, and all things indivisibly in a
manner and inseparably hold one of another. In sum, either there is a
God, and then all is well; or if all things go by chance and fortune,
yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those things that concern
thee properly; and then art thou well.

 Within a while the earth shall cover us all, and then she herself
shall have her change. And then the course will be, from one period of
eternity unto another, and so a perpetual eternity. Now can any man
that shall consider with himself in his mind the several rollings or
successions of so many changes and alterations, and the swiftness of all
these rulings; can he otherwise but contemn in his heart and despise
all worldly things? The cause of the universe is as it were a strong
torrent, it carrieth all away.

 And these your professed politicians, the only true practical
philosophers of the world, (as they think of themselves) so full of
affected gravity, or such professed lovers of virtue and honesty, what
wretches be they in very deed; how vile and contemptible in themselves?
O man! what ado doest thou keep? Do what thy nature doth now require.
Resolve upon it, if thou mayest: and take no thought, whether anybody
shall know it or no. Yea, but sayest thou, I must not expect a Plato's
commonwealth. If they profit though never so little, I must be content;
and think much even of that little progress. Doth then any of them
forsake their former false opinions that I should think they profit? For
without a change of opinions, alas! what is all that ostentation, but
mere wretchedness of slavish minds, that groan privately, and yet would
make a show of obedience to reason, and truth? Go too now and tell me
of Alexander and Philippus, and Demetrius Phalereus. Whether they
understood what the common nature requireth, and could rule themselves
or no, they know best themselves. But if they kept a life, and
swaggered; I (God be thanked) am not bound to imitate them. The effect
of true philosophy is, unaffected simplicity and modesty. Persuade me
not to ostentation and vainglory.

 From some high place as it were to look down, and to behold
here flocks, and there sacrifices, without number; and all kind of
navigation; some in a rough and stormy sea, and some in a calm: the
general differences, or different estates of things, some, that are now
first upon being; the several and mutual relations of those things that
are together; and some other things that are at their last. Their lives
also, who were long ago, and theirs who shall be hereafter, and the
present estate and life of those many nations of barbarians that are
now in the world, thou must likewise consider in thy mind. And how many
there be, who never so much as heard of thy name, how many that will
soon forget it; how many who but even now did commend thee, within a
very little while perchance will speak ill of thee. So that neither
fame, nor honour, nor anything else that this world doth afford, is
worth the while. The sum then of all; whatsoever doth happen unto thee,
whereof God is the cause, to accept it contentedly: whatsoever thou
doest, whereof thou thyself art the cause, to do it justly: which will
be, if both in thy resolution and in thy action thou have no further
end, than to do good unto others, as being that, which by thy natural
constitution, as a man, thou art bound unto.

 Many of those things that trouble and straiten thee, it is in thy
power to cut off, as wholly depending from mere conceit and opinion; and
then thou shalt have room enough.

 To comprehend the whole world together in thy mind, and the whole
course of this present age to represent it unto thyself, and to fix thy
thoughts upon the sudden change of every particular object. How short
the time is from the generation of anything, unto the dissolution of
the same; but how immense and infinite both that which was before the
generation, and that which after the generation of it shall be. All
things that thou seest, will soon be perished, and they that see their
corruptions, will soon vanish away themselves. He that dieth a hundred
years old, and he that dieth young, shall come all to one.

 What are their minds and understandings; and what the things that
they apply themselves unto: what do they love, and what do they hate
for? Fancy to thyself the estate of their souls openly to be seen. When
they think they hurt them shrewdly, whom they speak ill of; and when
they think they do them a very good turn, whom they commend and extol: O
how full are they then of conceit, and opinion!

 Loss and corruption, is in very deed nothing else but change and
alteration; and that is it, which the nature of the universe doth most
delight in, by which, and according to which, whatsoever is done, is
well done. For that was the estate of worldly things from the beginning,
and so shall it ever be. Or wouldest thou rather say, that all things
in the world have gone ill from the beginning for so many ages, and
shall ever go ill? And then among so many deities, could no divine power
be found all this while, that could rectify the things of the world? Or
is the world, to incessant woes and miseries, for ever condemned?

 How base and putrid, every common matter is! Water, dust, and
from the mixture of these bones, and all that loathsome stuff that our
bodies do consist of: so subject to be infected, and corrupted. And
again those other things that are so much prized and admired, as marble
stones, what are they, but as it were the kernels of the earth? gold and
silver, what are they, but as the more gross faeces of the earth? Thy
most royal apparel, for matter, it is but as it were the hair of a silly
sheep, and for colour, the very blood of a shell-fish; of this nature
are all other things. Thy life itself, is some such thing too; a mere
exhalation of blood: and it also, apt to be changed into some other
common thing.

 Will this querulousness, this murmuring, this complaining and
dissembling never be at an end? What then is it, that troubleth thee?
Doth any new thing happen unto thee? What doest thou so wonder at? At
the cause, or the matter? Behold either by itself, is either of that
weight and moment indeed? And besides these, there is not anything. But
thy duty towards the Gods also, it is time thou shouldst acquit thyself
of it with more goodness and simplicity.

 It is all one to see these things for a hundred of years together
or but for three years.

 If he have sinned, his is the harm, not mine. But perchance he
hath not.

 Either all things by the providence of reason happen unto every
particular, as a part of one general body; and then it is against reason
that a part should complain of anything that happens for the good of the
whole; or if, according to Epicurus, atoms be the cause of all things
and that life be nothing else but an accidentary confusion of things,
and death nothing else, but a mere dispersion and so of all other
things: what doest thou trouble thyself for?

 Sayest thou unto that rational part, Thou art dead; corruption
hath taken hold on thee? Doth it then also void excrements? Doth it like
either oxen, or sheep, graze or feed; that it also should be mortal, as
well as the body?

 Either the Gods can do nothing for us at all, or they can still and
allay all the distractions and distempers of thy mind. If they can do
nothing, why doest thou pray? If they can, why wouldst not thou rather
pray, that they will grant unto thee, that thou mayst neither fear, nor
lust after any of those worldly things which cause these distractions
and distempers of it? Why not rather, that thou mayst not at either
their absence or presence, be grieved and discontented: than either that
thou mayst obtain them, or that thou mayst avoid them? For certainly
it must needs be, that if the Gods can help us in anything, they may in
this kind also. But thou wilt say perchance, 'In those things the Gods
have given me my liberty: and it is in mine own power to do what I
will.' But if thou mayst use this liberty, rather to set thy mind at
true liberty, than wilfully with baseness and servility of mind to
affect those things, which either to compass or to avoid is not in thy
power, wert not thou better? And as for the Gods, who hath told thee,
that they may not help us up even in those things that they have put in
our own power? whether it be so or no, thou shalt soon perceive, if
thou wilt but try thyself and pray. One prayeth that he may compass his
desire, to lie with such or such a one, pray thou that thou mayst not
lust to lie with her. Another how he may be rid of such a one; pray thou
that thou mayst so patiently bear with him, as that thou have no such
need to be rid of him. Another, that he may not lose his child. Pray
thou that thou mayst not fear to lose him. To this end and purpose, let
all thy prayer be, and see what will be the event.

 'In my sickness' (saith Epicurus of himself:) 'my discourses were
not concerning the nature of my disease, neither was that, to them that
came to visit me, the subject of my talk; but in the consideration and
contemplation of that, which was of especial weight and moment, was all
my time bestowed and spent, and among others in this very thing, how my
mind, by a natural and unavoidable sympathy partaking in some sort with
the present indisposition of my body, might nevertheless keep herself
free from trouble, and in present possession of her own proper
happiness. Neither did I leave the ordering of my body to the physicians
altogether to do with me what they would, as though I expected any
great matter from them, or as though I thought it a matter of such great
consequence, by their means to recover my health: for my present estate,
methought, liked me very well, and gave me good content.' Whether
therefore in sickness (if thou chance to sicken) or in what other kind
of extremity soever, endeavour thou also to be in thy mind so affected,
as he doth report of himself: not to depart from thy philosophy for
anything that can befall thee, nor to give ear to the discourses of
silly people, and mere naturalists.

 It is common to all trades and professions to mind and intend that
only, which now they are about, and the instrument whereby they work.

 When at any time thou art offended with any one's impudency, put
presently this question to thyself: 'What? Is it then possible, that
there should not be any impudent men in the world! Certainly it is not
possible.' Desire not then that which is impossible. For this one, (thou
must think) whosoever he be, is one of those impudent ones, that
the world cannot be without. So of the subtile and crafty, so of the
perfidious, so of every one that offendeth, must thou ever be ready to
reason with thyself. For whilst in general thou dost thus reason with
thyself, that the kind of them must needs be in the world, thou wilt be
the better able to use meekness towards every particular. This also
thou shalt find of very good use, upon every such occasion, presently
to consider with thyself, what proper virtue nature hath furnished man
with, against such a vice, or to encounter with a disposition vicious
in this kind. As for example, against the unthankful, it hath given
goodness and meekness, as an antidote, and so against another vicious
in another kind some other peculiar faculty. And generally, is it not
in thy power to instruct him better, that is in an error? For whosoever
sinneth, doth in that decline from his purposed end, and is certainly
deceived, And again, what art thou the worse for his sin? For thou shalt
not find that any one of these, against whom thou art incensed, hath in
very deed done anything whereby thy mind (the only true subject of
thy hurt and evil) can be made worse than it was. And what a matter of
either grief or wonder is this, if he that is unlearned, do the deeds of
one that is unlearned? Should not thou rather blame thyself, who, when
upon very good grounds of reason, thou mightst have thought it very
probable, that such a thing would by such a one be committed, didst not
only not foresee it, but moreover dost wonder at it, that such a thing
should be. But then especially, when thou dost find fault with either an
unthankful, or a false man, must thou reflect upon thyself. For without
all question, thou thyself art much in fault, if either of one that were
of such a disposition, thou didst expect that he should be true unto
thee: or when unto any thou didst a good turn, thou didst not there
bound thy thoughts, as one that had obtained his end; nor didst not
think that from the action itself thou hadst received a full reward of
the good that thou hadst done. For what wouldst thou have more? Unto him
that is a man, thou hast done a good turn: doth not that suffice thee?
What thy nature required, that hast thou done. Must thou be rewarded for
it? As if either the eye for that it seeth, or the feet that they go,
should require satisfaction. For as these being by nature appointed for
such an use, can challenge no more, than that they may work according
to their natural constitution: so man being born to do good unto others
whensoever he doth a real good unto any by helping them out of error; or
though but in middle things, as in matter of wealth, life, preferment,
and the like, doth help to further their desires he doth that for which
he was made, and therefore can require no more.

 O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be good, simple,
single, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed.
Thou wilt one day be sensible of their happiness, whose end is love, and
their affections dead to all worldly things. Thou shalt one day be full,
and in want of no external thing: not seeking pleasure from anything,
either living or insensible, that this world can afford; neither wanting
time for the continuation of thy pleasure, nor place and opportunity,
nor the favour either of the weather or of men. When thou shalt have
content in thy present estate, and all things present shall add to thy
content: when thou shalt persuade thyself, that thou hast all things;
all for thy good, and all by the providence of the Gods: and of things
future also shalt be as confident, that all will do well, as tending to
the maintenance and preservation in some sort, of his perfect welfare
and happiness, who is perfection of life, of goodness, and beauty; who
begets all things, and containeth all things in himself, and in himself
doth recollect all things from all places that are dissolved, that of
them he may beget others again like unto them. Such one day shall be thy
disposition, that thou shalt be able, both in regard of the Gods, and
in regard of men, so to fit and order thy conversation, as neither
to complain of them at any time, for anything that they do; nor to do
anything thyself, for which thou mayest justly be condemned.

 As one who is altogether governed by nature, let it be thy care to
observe what it is that thy nature in general doth require. That
done, if thou find not that thy nature, as thou art a living sensible
creature, will be the worse for it, thou mayest proceed. Next then thou
must examine, what thy nature as thou art a living sensible creature,
doth require. And that, whatsoever it be, thou mayest admit of and do
it, if thy nature as thou art a reasonable living creature, will not be
the worse for it. Now whatsoever is reasonable, is also sociable, Keep
thyself to these rules, and trouble not thyself about idle things.

 Whatsoever doth happen unto thee, thou art naturally by thy natural
constitution either able, or not able to bear. If thou beest able, be
not offended, but bear it according to thy natural constitution, or as
nature hath enabled thee. If thou beest not able, be not offended. For
it will soon make an end of thee, and itself, (whatsoever it be) at the
same time end with thee. But remember, that whatsoever by the strength
of opinion, grounded upon a certain apprehension of both true profit and
duty, thou canst conceive tolerable; that thou art able to bear that by
thy natural constitution.

 Him that offends, to teach with love and meek ness, and to show him
his error. But if thou canst not, then to blame thyself; or rather not
thyself neither, if thy will and endeavours have not been wanting.

 Whatsoever it be that happens unto thee, it is that which from all
time was appointed unto thee. For by the same coherence of causes, by
which thy substance from all eternity was appointed to be, was also
whatsoever should happen unto it, destinated and appointed.

 Either with Epicurus, we must fondly imagine the atoms to be the
cause of all things, or we must needs grant a nature. Let this then be
thy first ground, that thou art part of that universe, which is governed
by nature. Then secondly, that to those parts that are of the same kind
and nature as thou art, thou hast relation of kindred. For of these,
if I shall always be mindful, first as I am a part, I shall never be
displeased with anything, that falls to my particular share of the
common chances of the world. For nothing that is behoveful unto the
whole, can be truly hurtful to that which is part of it. For this
being the common privilege of all natures, that they contain nothing in
themselves that is hurtful unto them; it cannot be that the nature of
the universe (whose privilege beyond other particular natures, is,
that she cannot against her will by any higher external cause be
constrained,) should beget anything and cherish it in her bosom that
should tend to her own hurt and prejudice. As then I bear in mind that
I am a part of such an universe, I shall not be displeased with anything
that happens. And as I have relation of kindred to those parts that
are of the same kind and nature that I am, so I shall be careful to
do nothing that is prejudicial to the community, but in all my
deliberations shall they that are of my kind ever be; and the common
good, that, which all my intentions and resolutions shall drive unto,
as that which is contrary unto it, I shall by all means endeavour to
prevent and avoid. These things once so fixed and concluded, as thou
wouldst think him a happy citizen, whose constant study and practice
were for the good and benefit of his fellow citizens, and the carriage
of the city such towards him, that he were well pleased with it; so must
it needs be with thee, that thou shalt live a happy life.

 All parts of the world, (all things I mean that are contained
within the whole world), must of necessity at some time or other come to
corruption. Alteration I should say, to speak truly and properly; but
that I may be the better understood, I am content at this time to use
that more common word. Now say I, if so be that this be both hurtful
unto them, and yet unavoidable, would not, thinkest thou, the whole
itself be in a sweet case, all the parts of it being subject to
alteration, yea and by their making itself fitted for corruption, as
consisting of things different and contrary? And did nature then either
of herself thus project and purpose the affliction and misery of her
parts, and therefore of purpose so made them, not only that haply they
might, but of necessity that they should fall into evil; or did not she
know what she did, when she made them? For either of these two to say,
is equally absurd. But to let pass nature in general, and to reason of
things particular according to their own particular natures; how absurd
and ridiculous is it, first to say that all parts of the whole are, by
their proper natural constitution, subject to alteration; and then when
any such thing doth happen, as when one doth fall sick and dieth, to
take on and wonder as though some strange thing had happened? Though
this besides might move not so grievously to take on when any such thing
doth happen, that whatsoever is dissolved, it is dissolved into those
things, whereof it was compounded. For every dissolution is either
a mere dispersion, of the elements into those elements again whereof
everything did consist, or a change, of that which is more solid into
earth; and of that which is pure and subtile or spiritual, into air.
So that by this means nothing is lost, but all resumed again into those
rational generative seeds of the universe; and this universe, either
after a certain period of time to lie consumed by fire, or by continual
changes to be renewed, and so for ever to endure. Now that solid and
spiritual that we speak of, thou must not conceive it to be that very
same, which at first was, when thou wert born. For alas! all this that
now thou art in either kind, either for matter of substance, or of life,
hath but two or three days ago partly from meats eaten, and partly from
air breathed in, received all its influx, being the same then in no
other respect, than a running river, maintained by the perpetual influx
and new supply of waters, is the same. That therefore which thou hast
since received, not that which came from thy mother, is that which
comes to change and corruption. But suppose that that for the general
substance, and more solid part of it, should still cleave unto thee
never so close, yet what is that to the proper qualities and affections
of it, by which persons are distinguished, which certainly are quite
different?

 Now that thou hast taken these names upon thee of good, modest,
true; of ἔμφρων, σύμφρων, ὑπέρφρων; take heed lest at any times by
doing anything that is contrary, thou be but improperly so called, and
lose thy right to these appellations. Or if thou do, return unto them
again with all possible speed. And remember, that the word ἔμφρων notes
unto thee an intent and intelligent consideration of every object that
presents itself unto thee, without distraction. And the word σύμφρων, a
ready and contented acceptation of whatsoever by the appointment of the
common nature, happens unto thee. And the word ὑπέρφρων, a
super-extension, or a transcendent, and outreaching disposition of thy
mind, whereby it passeth by all bodily pains and pleasures, honour and
credit, death and whatsoever is of the same nature, as matters of
absolute indifferency, and in no wise to be stood upon by a wise man.
These then if inviolably thou shalt observe, and shalt not be ambitious
to be so called by others, both thou thyself shalt become a new man,
and thou shalt begin a new life. For to continue such as hitherto thou
hast been, to undergo those distractions and distempers as thou must
needs for such a life as hitherto thou hast lived, is the part of one
that is very foolish, and is overfond of his life. Whom a man might
compare to one of those half-eaten wretches, matched in the
amphitheatre with wild beasts; who as full as they are all the body
over with wounds and blood, desire for a great favour, that they may be
reserved till the next day, then also, and in the same estate to be
exposed to the same nails and teeth as before. Away therefore, ship
thyself; and from the troubles and distractions of thy former life
convey thyself as it were unto these few names; and if thou canst abide
in them, or be constant in the practice and possession of them,
continue there as glad and joyful as one that were translated unto some
such place of bliss and happiness as that which by Hesiod and Plato is
called the Islands of the Blessed, by others called the Elysian Fields.
And whensoever thou findest thyself; that thou art in danger of a
relapse, and that thou art not able to master and overcome those
difficulties and temptations that present themselves in thy present
station: get thee into any private corner, where thou mayst be better
able. Or if that will not serve forsake even thy life rather. But so
that it be not in passion but in a plain voluntary modest way: this
being the only commendable action of thy whole life that thus thou art
departed, or this having been the main work and business of thy whole
life, that thou mightest thus depart. Now for the better remembrance of
those names that we have spoken of, thou shalt find it a very good
help, to remember the Gods as often as may be: and that, the thing
which they require at our hands of as many of us, as are by nature
reasonable creation is not that with fair words, and outward show of
piety and devotion we should flatter them, but that we should become
like unto them: and that as all other natural creatures, the fig tree
for example; the dog the bee: both do, all of them, and apply
themselves unto that which by their natural constitution, is proper
unto them; so man likewise should do that, which by his nature, as he
is a man, belongs unto him.

 Toys and fooleries at home, wars abroad: sometimes terror, sometimes
torpor, or stupid sloth: this is thy daily slavery. By little and
little, if thou doest not better look to it, those sacred dogmata will
be blotted out of thy mind. How many things be there, which when as
a mere naturalist, thou hast barely considered of according to their
nature, thou doest let pass without any further use? Whereas thou
shouldst in all things so join action and contemplation, that thou
mightest both at the same time attend all present occasions, to perform
everything duly and carefully and yet so intend the contemplative part
too, that no part of that delight and pleasure, which the contemplative
knowledge of everything according to its true nature doth of itself
afford, might be lost. Or, that the true and contemnplative knowledge
of everything according to its own nature, might of itself, (action
being subject to many lets and impediments) afford unto thee sufficient
pleasure and happiness. Not apparent indeed, but not concealed. And when
shalt thou attain to the happiness of true simplicity, and unaffected
gravity? When shalt thou rejoice in the certain knowledge of every
particular object according to its true nature: as what the matter and
substance of it is; what use it is for in the world: how long it can
subsist: what things it doth consist of: who they be that are capable of
it, and who they that can give it, and take it away?

 As the spider, when it hath caught the fly that it hunted after, is
not little proud, nor meanly conceited of herself: as he likewise that
hath caught an hare, or hath taken a fish with his net: as another for
the taking of a boar, and another of a bear: so may they be proud,
and applaud themselves for their valiant acts against the Sarmatai, or
northern nations lately defeated. For these also, these famous soldiers
and warlike men, if thou dost look into their minds and opinions, what
do they for the most part but hunt after prey?

 To find out, and set to thyself some certain way and method of
contemplation, whereby thou mayest clearly discern and represent unto
thyself, the mutual change of all things, the one into the other. Bear
it in thy mind evermore, and see that thou be throughly well exercised
in this particular. For there is not anything more effectual to beget
true magnanimity.

 He hath got loose from the bonds of his body, and perceiving that
within a very little while he must of necessity bid the world farewell,
and leave all these things behind him, he wholly applied himself, as to
righteousness in all his actions, so to the common nature in all things
that should happen unto him. And contenting himself with these two
things, to do all things justly, and whatsoever God doth send to like
well of it: what others shall either say or think of him, or shall do
against him, he doth not so much as trouble his thoughts with it. To go
on straight, whither right and reason directed him, and by so doing to
follow God, was the only thing that he did mind, that, his only business
and occupation.

 What use is there of suspicion at all? or, why should thoughts
of mistrust, and suspicion concerning that which is future, trouble thy
mind at all? What now is to be done, if thou mayest search and inquiry
into that, what needs thou care for more? And if thou art well able to
perceive it alone, let no man divert thee from it. But if alone thou
doest not so well perceive it, suspend thine action, and take advice
from the best. And if there be anything else that doth hinder thee, go
on with prudence and discretion, according to the present occasion
and opportunity, still proposing that unto thyself, which thou doest
conceive most right and just. For to hit that aright, and to speed in
the prosecution of it, must needs be happiness, since it is that only
which we can truly and properly be said to miss of, or miscarry in.

 What is that that is slow, and yet quick? merry, and yet grave? He
that in all things doth follow reason for his guide.

 In the morning as soon as thou art awaked, when thy judgment, before
either thy affections, or external objects have wrought upon it, is yet
most free and impartial: put this question to thyself, whether if that
which is right and just be done, the doing of it by thyself, or by
others when thou art not able thyself; be a thing material or no. For
sure it is not. And as for these that keep such a life, and stand so
much upon the praises, or dispraises of other men, hast thou forgotten
what manner of men they be? that such and such upon their beds, and such
at their board: what their ordinary actions are: what they pursue after,
and what they fly from: what thefts and rapines they commit, if not with
their hands and feet, yet with that more precious part of theirs, their
minds: which (would it but admit of them) might enjoy faith, modesty,
truth, justice, a good spirit.

 Give what thou wilt, and take away what thou wilt, saith he that is
well taught and truly modest, to Him that gives, and takes away. And it
is not out of a stout and peremptory resolution, that he saith it, but
in mere love, and humble submission.

 So live as indifferent to the world and all worldly objects, as
one who liveth by himself alone upon some desert hill. For whether here,
or there, if the whole world be but as one town, it matters not much for
the place. Let them behold and see a man, that is a man indeed, living
according to the true nature of man. If they cannot bear with me, let
them kill me. For better were it to die, than so to live as they would
have thee.

 Make it not any longer a matter of dispute or discourse, what are
the signs and proprieties of a good man, but really and actually to be
such.

 Ever to represent unto thyself; and to set before thee, both the
general age and time of the world, and the whole substance of it. And
how all things particular in respect of these are for their substance,
as one of the least seeds that is: and for their duration, as the
turning of the pestle in the mortar once about. Then to fix thy mind
upon every particular object of the world, and to conceive it, (as it
is indeed,) as already being in the state of dissolution, and of change;
tending to some kind of either putrefaction or dispersion; or whatsoever
else it is, that is the death as it were of everything in his own kind.

 Consider them through all actions and occupations, of their lives:
as when they eat, and when they sleep: when they are in the act of
necessary exoneration, and when in the act of lust. Again, when they
either are in their greatest exultation; and in the middle of all
their pomp and glory; or being angry and displeased, in great state and
majesty, as from an higher place, they chide and rebuke. How base and
slavish, but a little while ago, they were fain to be, that they might
come to this; and within a very little while what will be their estate,
when death hath once seized upon them.

 That is best for every one, that the common nature of all doth send
unto every one, and then is it best, when she doth send it.

 The earth, saith the poet, doth often long after the rain. So is
the glorious sky often as desirous to fall upon the earth, which argues
a mutual kind of love between them. And so (say I) doth the world bear
a certain affection of love to whatsoever shall come to pass With thine
affections shall mine concur, O world. The same (and no other) shall the
object of my longing be which is of thine. Now that the world doth love
it is true indeed so is it as commonly said, and acknowledged ledged,
when, according to the Greek phrase, imitated by the Latins, of things
that used to be, we say commonly, that they love to be.

 Either thou dost Continue in this kind of life and that is it,
which so long thou hast been used unto and therefore tolerable: or thou
doest retire, or leave the world, and that of thine own accord, and then
thou hast thy mind: or thy life is cut off; and then mayst thou
rejoice that thou hast ended thy charge. One of these must needs be.
Be therefore of good comfort.

XXIV Let it always appear and be manifest unto thee that solitariness,
and desert places, by many philosophers so much esteemed of and
affected, are of themselves but thus and thus; and that all things are
them to them that live in towns, and converse with others as they are
the same nature everywhere to be seen and observed: to them that have
retired themselves to the top of mountains, and to desert havens, or
what other desert and inhabited places soever. For anywhere it thou wilt
mayest thou quickly find and apply that to thyself; which Plato saith of
his philosopher, in a place: as private and retired, saith he, as if he
were shut up and enclosed about in some shepherd's lodge, on the top of
a hill. There by thyself to put these questions to thyself or to enter
in these considerations: What is my chief and principal part, which hath
power over the rest? What is now the present estate of it, as I use it;
and what is it, that I employ it about? Is it now void of reason ir no?
Is it free, and separated; or so affixed, so congealed and grown
together as it were with the flesh, that it is swayed by the motions and
inclinations of it?

 He that runs away from his master is a fugitive. But the law is
every man's master. He therefore that forsakes the law, is a fugitive.
So is he, whosoever he be, that is either sorry, angry, or afraid, or
for anything that either hath been, is, or shall be by his appointment,
who is the Lord and Governor of the universe. For he truly and properly
is Νόμος, or the law, as the only νέμων, or distributor and dispenser
of all things that happen unto any one in his lifetime--Whatsoever then
is either sorry, angry, or afraid, is a fugitive.

 From man is the seed, that once cast into the womb man hath no
more to do with it. Another cause succeedeth, and undertakes the
work, and in time brings a child (that wonderful effect from such a
beginning!) to perfection. Again, man lets food down through his
throat; and that once down, he hath no more to do with it. Another
cause succeedeth and distributeth this food into the senses, and the
affections: into life, and into strength; and doth with it those other
many and marvellous things, that belong unto man. These things therefore
that are so secretly and invisibly wrought and brought to pass, thou
must use to behold and contemplate; and not the things themselves only,
but the power also by which they are effected; that thou mayst behold
it, though not with the eyes of the body, yet as plainly and visibly as
thou canst see and discern the outward efficient cause of the depression
and elevation of anything.

 Ever to mind and consider with thyself; how all things that now
are, have been heretofore much after the same sort, and after the same
fashion that now they are: and so to think of those things which shall
be hereafter also. Moreover, whole dramata, and uniform scenes, or
scenes that comprehend the lives and actions of men of one calling and
profession, as many as either in thine own experience thou hast known,
or by reading of ancient histories; (as the whole court of Adrianus,
the whole court of Antoninus Pius, the whole court of Philippus, that of
Alexander, that of Crœsus): to set them all before thine eyes. For thou
shalt find that they are all but after one sort and fashion: only that
the actors were others.

 As a pig that cries and flings when his throat is cut, fancy to
thyself every one to be, that grieves for any worldly thing and takes
on. Such a one is he also, who upon his bed alone, doth bewail
the miseries of this our mortal life. And remember this, that Unto
reasonable creatures only it is granted that they may willingly and
freely submit unto Providence: but absolutely to submit, is a necessity
imposed upon all creatures equally.

 Whatsoever it is that thou goest about, consider of it by thyself,
and ask thyself, What? because I shall do this no more when I am dead,
should therefore death seem grievous unto me?

 When thou art offended with any man's transgression, presently
reflect upon thyself; and consider what thou thyself art guilty of in
the same kind. As that thou also perchance dost think it a happiness
either to be rich, or to live in pleasure, or to be praised and
commended, and so of the rest in particular. For this if thou shalt call
to mind, thou shalt soon forget thine anger; especially when at the same
time this also shall concur in thy thoughts, that he was constrained by
his error and ignorance so to do: for how can he choose as long as he
is of that opinion? Do thou therefore if thou canst, take away that from
him, that forceth him to do as he doth.

 When thou seest Satyro, think of Socraticus and Eutyches, or
Hymen, and when Euphrates, think of Eutychio, and Sylvanus, when
Alciphron, of Tropaeophorus, when Xenophon, of Crito, or Severus. And
when thou doest look upon thyself, fancy unto thyself some one or other
of the Cæsars; and so for every one, some one or other that hath been
for estate and profession answerable unto him. Then let this come to thy
mind at the same time; and where now are they all? Nowhere or anywhere?
For so shalt thou at all time be able to perceive how all worldly
things are but as the smoke, that vanisheth away: or, indeed, mere
nothing. Especially when thou shalt call to mind this also, that
whatsoever is once changed, shall never be again as long as the world
endureth. And thou then, how long shalt thou endure? And why doth it not
suffice thee, if virtuously, and as becometh thee, thou mayest pass that
portion of time, how little soever it be, that is allotted unto thee?

 What a subject, and what a course of life is it, that thou doest
so much desire to be rid of. For all these things, what are they, but
fit objects for an understanding, that beholdeth everything according to
its true nature, to exercise itself upon? Be patient, therefore, until
that (as a strong stomach that turns all things into his own nature; and
as a great fire that turneth in flame and light, whatsoever thou doest
cast into it) thou have made these things also familiar, and as it were
natural unto thee.

 Let it not be in any man's power, to say truly of thee, that
thou art not truly simple, or sincere and open, or not good. Let him be
deceived whosoever he be that shall have any such opinion of thee. For
all this doth depend of thee. For who is it that should hinder thee from
being either truly simple or good? Do thou only resolve rather not to
live, than not to be such. For indeed neither doth it stand with reason
that he should live that is not such. What then is it that may upon this
present occasion according to best reason and discretion, either be said
or done? For whatsoever it be, it is in thy power either to do it, or
to say it, and therefore seek not any pretences, as though thou wert
hindered. Thou wilt never cease groaning and complaining, until such
time as that, what pleasure is unto the voluptuous, be unto thee, to do
in everything that presents itself, whatsoever may be done conformably
and agreeably to the proper constitution of man, or, to man as he is a
man. For thou must account that pleasure, whatsoever it be, that thou
mayest do according to thine own nature. And to do this, every place
will fit thee. Unto the _cylindrus_, or roller, it is not granted to
move everywhere according to its own proper motion, as neither unto
the water, nor unto the fire, nor unto any other thing, that either is
merely natural, or natural and sensitive; but not rational for many
things there be that can hinder their operations. But of the mind and
understanding this is the proper privilege, that according to its own
nature, and as it will itself, it can pass through every obstacle that
it finds, and keep straight on forwards. Setting therefore before thine
eyes this happiness and felicity of thy mind, whereby it is able to pass
through all things, and is capable of all motions, whether as the fire,
upwards; or as the stone downwards, or as the _cylindrus_ through that
which is sloping: content thyself with it, and seek not after any other
thing. For all other kind of hindrances that are not hindrances of thy
mind either they are proper to the body, or merely proceed from the
opinion, reason not making that resistance that it should, but basely,
and cowardly suffering itself to be foiled; and of themselves can
neither wound, nor do any hurt at all. Else must he of necessity,
whosoever he be that meets with any of them, become worse than he was
before. For so is it in all other subjects, that that is thought hurtful
unto them, whereby they are made worse. But here contrariwise, man (if
he make that good use of them that he should) is rather the better
and the more praiseworthy for any of those kind of hindrances, than
otherwise. But generally remember that nothing can hurt a natural
citizen, that is not hurtful unto the city itself, nor anything hurt
the city, that is not hurtful unto the law itself. But none of these
casualties, or external hindrances, do hurt the law itself; or, are
contrary to that course of justice and equity, by which public societies
are maintained: neither therefore do they hurt either city or citizen.

 As he that is bitten by a mad dog, is afraid of everything almost
that he seeth: so unto him, whom the dogmata have once bitten, or in
whom true knowledge hath made an impression, everything almost that
he sees or reads be it never so short or ordinary, doth afford a good
memento; to put him out of all grief and fear, as that of the poet, 'The
winds blow upon the trees, and their leaves fall upon the ground. Then
do the trees begin to bud again, and by the spring-time they put forth
new branches. So is the generation of men; some come into the world, and
others go out of it.' Of these leaves then thy children are. And they
also that applaud thee so gravely, or, that applaud thy speeches, with
that their usual acclamation, ἀξιοπίστως, O wisely spoken I and speak
well of thee, as on the other side, they that stick not to curse thee,
they that privately and secretly dispraise and deride thee, they also
are but leaves. And they also that shall follow, in whose memories
the names of men famous after death, is preserved, they are but leaves
neither. For even so is it of all these worldly things. Their spring
comes, and they are put forth. Then blows the wind, and they go down.
And then in lieu of them grow others out of the wood or common matter
of all things, like unto them. But, to endure but for a while, is common
unto all. Why then shouldest thou so earnestly either seek after these
things, or fly from them, as though they should endure for ever? Yet a
little while, and thine eyes will be closed up, and for him that carries
thee to thy grave shall another mourn within a while after.

 A good eye must be good to see whatsoever is to be seen, and not
green things only. For that is proper to sore eyes. So must a good
ear, and a good smell be ready for whatsoever is either to be heard,
or smelt: and a good stomach as indifferent to all kinds of food, as
a millstone is, to whatsoever she was made for to grind. As ready
therefore must a sound understanding be for whatsoever shall happen. But
he that saith, O that my children might live! and, O that all men might
commend me for whatsoever I do! is an eye that seeks after green things;
or as teeth, after that which is tender.

 There is not any man that is so happy in his death, but that some
of those that are by him when he dies, will be ready to rejoice at his
supposed calamity. Is it one that was virtuous and wise indeed? will
there not some one or other be found, who thus will say to himself;
'Well now at last shall I be at rest from this pedagogue. He did not
indeed otherwise trouble us much: but I know well enough that in his
heart, he did much condemn us.' Thus will they speak of the virtuous.
But as for us, alas I how many things be there, for which there be many
that glad would be to be rid of us. This therefore if thou shalt think
of whensoever thou diest, thou shalt die the more willingly, when thou
shalt think with thyself; I am now to depart from that world, wherein
those that have been my nearest friends and acquaintances, they whom I
have so much suffered for, so often prayed for, and for whom I have
taken such care, even they would have me die, hoping that after my death
they shall live happier, than they did before. What then should any man
desire to continue here any longer? Nevertheless, whensoever thou diest,
thou must not be less kind and loving unto them for it; but as before,
see them, continue to be their friend, to wish them well, and meekly,
and gently to carry thyself towards them, but yet so that on the other
side, it make thee not the more unwilling to die. But as it fareth with
them that die an easy quick death, whose soul is soon separated from
their bodies, so must thy separation from them be. To these had nature
joined and annexed me: now she parts us; I am ready to depart, as from
friends and kinsmen, but yet without either reluctancy or compulsion.
For this also is according to Nature.

 Use thyself; as often, as thou seest any man do anything,
presently (if it be possible) to say unto thyself, What is this man's
end in this his action? But begin this course with thyself first of all,
and diligently examine thyself concerning whatsoever thou doest.

 Remember, that that which sets a man at work, and hath power
over the affections to draw them either one way, or the other way, is
not any external thing properly, but that which is hidden within every
man's dogmata, and opinions: That, that is rhetoric; that is life; that
(to speak true) is man himself. As for thy body, which as a vessel, or
a case, compasseth thee about, and the many and curious instruments
that it hath annexed unto it, let them not trouble thy thoughts. For
of themselves they are but as a carpenter's axe, but that they are born
with us, and naturally sticking unto us. But otherwise, without the
inward cause that hath power to move them, and to restrain them, those
parts are of themselves of no more use unto us, than the shuttle is
of itself to the weaver, or the pen to the writer, or the whip to the
coachman.

 The natural properties, and privileges of a reasonable soul are: That
she seeth herself; that she can order, and compose herself: that
she makes herself as she will herself: that she reaps her own fruits
whatsoever, whereas plants, trees, unreasonable creatures, what fruit
soever (be it either fruit properly, or analogically only) they bear,
they bear them unto others, and not to themselves. Again; whensoever,
and wheresoever, sooner or later, her life doth end, she hath her own
end nevertheless. For it is not with her, as with dancers and players,
who if they be interrupted in any part of their action, the whole action
must needs be imperfect: but she in what part of time or action soever
she be surprised, can make that which she hath in her hand whatsoever it
be, complete and full, so that she may depart with that comfort, 'I have
lived; neither want I anything of that which properly did belong unto
me.' Again, she compasseth the whole world, and penetrateth into the
vanity, and mere outside (wanting substance and solidity) of it, and
stretcheth herself unto the infiniteness of eternity; and the revolution
or restoration of all things after a certain period of time, to the same
state and place as before, she fetcheth about, and doth comprehend in
herself; and considers withal, and sees clearly this, that neither they
that shall follow us, shall see any new thing, that we have not seen,
nor they that went before, anything more than we: but that he that is
once come to forty (if he have any wit at all) can in a manner (for
that they are all of one kind) see all things, both past and future. As
proper is it, and natural to the soul of man to love her neighbour, to
be true and modest; and to regard nothing so much as herself: which is
also the property of the law: whereby by the way it appears, that sound
reason and justice comes all to one, and therefore that justice is the
chief thing, that reasonable creatures ought to propose unto themselves
as their end.

 A pleasant song or dance; the Pancratiast's exercise, sports that
thou art wont to be much taken with, thou shalt easily contemn; if
the harmonious voice thou shalt divide into so many particular sounds
whereof it doth consist, and of every one in particular shall ask
thyself; whether this or that sound is it, that doth so conquer thee.
For thou wilt be ashamed of it. And so for shame, if accordingly thou
shalt consider it, every particular motion and posture by itself: and
so for the wrestler's exercise too. Generally then, whatsoever it be,
besides virtue, and those things that proceed from virtue that thou art
subject to be much affected with, remember presently thus to divide
it, and by this kind of division, in each particular to attain unto the
contempt of the whole. This thou must transfer and apply to thy whole
life also.

 That soul which is ever ready, even now presently (if need be) from
the body, whether by way of extinction, or dispersion, or continuation
in another place and estate to be separated, how blessed and happy is
it! But this readiness of it, it must proceed, not from an obstinate and
peremptory resolution of the mind, violently and passionately set upon
Opposition, as Christians are wont; but from a peculiar judgment; with
discretion and gravity, so that others may be persuaded also and drawn
to the like example, but without any noise and passionate exclamations.

 Have I done anything charitably? then am I benefited by it. See
that this upon all occasions may present itself unto thy mind, and never
cease to think of it. What is thy profession? to be good. And how should
this be well brought to pass, but by certain theorems and doctrines;
some Concerning the nature of the universe, and some Concerning the
proper and particular constitution of man?

 Tragedies were at first brought in and instituted, to put men in mind
of worldly chances and casualties: that these things in the ordinary
course of nature did so happen: that men that were much pleased and
delighted by such accidents upon this stage, would not by the same
things in a greater stage be grieved and afflicted: for here you see
what is the end of all such things; and that even they that cry out
so mournfully to Cithaeron, must bear them for all their cries and
exclamations, as well as others. And in very truth many good things are
spoken by these poets; as that (for example) is an excellent passage:
'But if so be that I and my two children be neglected by the Gods, they
have some reason even for that,' &c. And again, 'It will but little
avail thee to storm and rage against the things themselves,' &c. Again,
'To reap one's life, as a ripe ear of corn;' and whatsoever else is
to be found in them, that is of the same kind. After the tragedy, the
ancient comedy was brought in, which had the liberty to inveigh against
personal vices; being therefore through this her freedom and liberty
of speech of very good use and effect, to restrain men from pride
and arrogancy. To which end it was, that Diogenes took also the same
liberty. After these, what were either the Middle, or New Comedy
admitted for, but merely, (Or for the most part at least) for the
delight and pleasure of curious and excellent imitation? 'It will steal
away; look to it,' &c. Why, no man denies, but that these also have some
good things whereof that may be one: but the whole drift and foundation
of that kind of dramatical poetry, what is it else, but as we have said?

 How clearly doth it appear unto thee, that no other course of thy
life could fit a true philosopher's practice better, than this very
course, that thou art now already in?

 A branch cut off from the continuity of that which was next unto
it, must needs be cut off from the whole tree: so a man that is divided
from another man, is divided from the whole society. A branch is cut off
by another, but he that hates and is averse, cuts himself off from his
neighbour, and knows not that at the same time he divides himself from
the whole body, or corporation. But herein is the gift and mercy of God,
the Author of this society, in that, once cut off we may grow together
and become part of the whole again. But if this happen often the misery
is that the further a man is run in this division, the harder he is to
be reunited and restored again: and however the branch which, once cut
of afterwards was graffed in, gardeners can tell you is not like that
which sprouted together at first, and still continued in the unity of
the body.

 To grow together like fellow branches in matter of good
correspondence and affection; but not in matter of opinions. They that
shall oppose thee in thy right courses, as it is not in their power to
divert thee from thy good action, so neither let it be to divert thee
from thy good affection towards them. But be it thy care to keep thyself
constant in both; both in a right judgment and action, and in true
meekness towards them, that either shall do their endeavour to hinder
thee, or at least will be displeased with thee for what thou hast done.
For to fail in either (either in the one to give over for fear, or in
the other to forsake thy natural affection towards him, who by nature is
both thy friend and thy kinsman) is equally base, and much savouring of
the disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier.

 It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art,
since that all arts imitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect
and general nature of all natures should in her operation come short of
the skill of arts, is most improbable. Now common is it to all arts, to
make that which is worse for the better's sake. Much more then doth the
common nature do the same. Hence is the first ground of justice. From
justice all other virtues have their existence. For justice cannot be
preserved, if either we settle our minds and affections upon worldly
things; or be apt to be deceived, or rash, and inconstant.

 The things themselves (which either to get or to avoid thou art put
to so much trouble) come not unto thee themselves; but thou in a manner
goest unto them. Let then thine own judgment and opinion concerning
those things be at rest; and as for the things themselves, they stand
still and quiet, without any noise or stir at all; and so shall all
pursuing and flying cease.

 Then is the soul as Empedocles doth liken it, like unto a sphere or
globe, when she is all of one form and figure: when she neither greedily
stretcheth out herself unto anything, nor basely contracts herself, or
lies flat and dejected; but shineth all with light, whereby she does see
and behold the true nature, both that of the universe, and her own in
particular.

 Will any contemn me? let him look to that, upon what grounds he
does it: my care shall be that I may never be found either doing or
speaking anything that doth truly deserve contempt. Will any hate me?
let him look to that. I for my part will be kind and loving unto all,
and even unto him that hates me, whom-soever he be, will I be ready to
show his error, not by way of exprobation or ostentation of my patience,
but ingenuously and meekly: such as was that famous Phocion, if so be
that he did not dissemble. For it is inwardly that these things must be:
that the Gods who look inwardly, and not upon the outward appearance,
may behold a man truly free from all indignation and grief. For what
hurt can it be unto thee whatsoever any man else doth, as long as thou
mayest do that which is proper and suitable to thine own nature? Wilt
not thou (a man wholly appointed to be both what, and as the common good
shall require) accept of that which is now seasonable to the nature
of the universe?

 They contemn one another, and yet they seek to please one another:
and whilest they seek to surpass one another in worldly pomp and
greatness, they most debase and prostitute themselves in their better
part one to another.

 How rotten and insincere is he, that saith, I am resolved to carry
myself hereafter towards you with all ingenuity and simplicity. O man,
what doest thou mean! what needs this profession of thine? the thing
itself will show it. It ought to be written upon thy forehead. No sooner
thy voice is heard, than thy countenance must be able to show what is in
thy mind: even as he that is loved knows presently by the looks of his
sweetheart what is in her mind. Such must he be for all the world, that
is truly simple and good, as he whose arm-holes are offensive, that
whosoever stands by, as soon as ever he comes near him, may as it were
smell him whether he will or no. But the affectation of simplicity
is nowise laudable. There is nothing more shameful than perfidious
friendship. Above all things, that must be avoided. However true
goodness, simplicity, and kindness cannot so be hidden, but that as
we have already said in the very eyes and countenance they will show
themselves.

 To live happily is an inward power of the soul, when she is affected
with indifferency, towards those things that are by their nature
indifferent. To be thus affected she must consider all worldly objects
both divided and whole: remembering withal that no object can of itself
beget any opinion in us, neither can come to us, but stands without
still and quiet; but that we ourselves beget, and as it were print in
ourselves opinions concerning them. Now it is in our power, not to print
them; and if they creep in and lurk in some corner, it is in our
power to wipe them off. Remembering moreover, that this care and
circumspection of thine, is to continue but for a while, and then thy
life will be at an end. And what should hinder, but that thou mayest do
well with all these things? For if they be according to nature, rejoice
in them, and let them be pleasing and acceptable unto thee. But if
they be against nature, seek thou that which is according to thine own
nature, and whether it be for thy credit or no, use all possible speed
for the attainment of it: for no man ought to be blamed, for seeking his
own good and happiness.

 Of everything thou must consider from whence it came, of what
things it doth consist, and into what it will be changed: what will be
the nature of it, or what it will be like unto when it is changed; and
that it can suffer no hurt by this change. And as for other men's either
foolishness or wickedness, that it may not trouble and grieve thee;
first generally thus; What reference have I unto these? and that we are
all born for one another's good: then more particularly after another
consideration; as a ram is first in a flock of sheep, and a bull in a
herd of cattle, so am I born to rule over them. Begin yet higher, even
from this: if atoms be not the beginning of all things, than which to
believe nothing can be more absurd, then must we needs grant that there
is a nature, that doth govern the universe. If such a nature, then are
all worse things made for the better's sake; and all better for one
another's sake. Secondly, what manner of men they be, at board, and upon
their beds, and so forth. But above all things, how they are forced by
their opinions that they hold, to do what they do; and even those things
that they do, with what pride and self-conceit they do them. Thirdly,
that if they do these things rightly, thou hast no reason to be grieved.
But if not rightly, it must needs be that they do them against their
wills, and through mere ignorance. For as, according to Plato's opinion,
no soul doth willingly err, so by consequent neither doth it anything
otherwise than it ought, but against her will. Therefore are they
grieved, whensoever they hear themselves charged, either of injustice,
or unconscionableness, or covetousness, or in general, of any injurious
kind of dealing towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thyself
doest transgress in many things, and art even such another as they are.
And though perchance thou doest forbear the very act of some sins, yet
hast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to them, but that either
through fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious foolish
respect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or
no, thou doest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by
way of discreet policy; and generally a man must know many things
first, before he be able truly and judiciously to judge of another
man's action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on grievously, or
makest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man's life is
but for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our
graves. Seventhly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves
that trouble us properly; for they have their existence in their
minds and understandings only, that commit them; but our own opinions
concerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to part with that
conceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed
thine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself
that it is not shameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only
true evil that is, thou also wilt be driven whilest thou doest follow
the common instinct of nature, to avoid that which is evil, to commit
many unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, that will
make to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends. Eighthly, how many
things may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief;
far more grievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so
grieved or angry for. Ninthly, that meekness is a thing unconquerable,
if it be true and natural, and not affected or hypocritical. For how
shall even the most fierce and malicious that thou shalt conceive, be
able to hold on against thee, if thou shalt still continue meek and
loving unto him; and that even at that time, when he is about to do
thee wrong, thou shalt be well disposed, and in good temper, with all
meekness to teach him, and to instruct him better? As for example; My
son, we were not born for this, to hurt and annoy one another; it will
be thy hurt not mine, my son: and so to show him forcibly and fully,
that it is so in very deed: and that neither bees do it one to another,
nor any other creatures that are naturally sociable. But this thou must
do, not scoffingly, not by way of exprobation, but tenderly without
any harshness of words. Neither must thou do it by way of exercise, or
ostentation, that they that are by and hear thee, may admire thee: but
so always that nobody be privy to it, but himself alone: yea, though
there be more present at the same time. These nine particular heads, as
so many gifts from the Muses, see that thou remember well: and begin one
day, whilest thou art yet alive, to be a man indeed. But on the other
side thou must take heed, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with
them: for both are equally uncharitable, and equally hurtful. And in thy
passions, take it presently to thy consideration, that to be angry is
not the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it savours of
more humanity, so of more manhood. That in this, there is strength
and nerves, or vigour and fortitude: whereof anger and indignation is
altogether void. For the nearer everything is unto unpassionateness,
the nearer it is unto power. And as grief doth proceed from weakness,
so doth anger. For both, both he that is angry and that grieveth, have
received a wound, and cowardly have as it were yielded themselves unto
their affections. If thou wilt have a tenth also, receive this tenth
gift from Hercules the guide and leader of the Muses: that is a mad
man's part, to look that there should be no wicked men in the world,
because it is impossible. Now for a man to brook well enough, that there
should be wicked men in the world, but not to endure that any
should transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed
tyrannical.

 Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and
understanding, which to be aware of, thou must carefully observe: and
whensoever thou doest discover them, thou must rectify them, saying to
thyself concerning every one of them, This imagination is not necessary;
this is uncharitable: this thou shalt speak as another man's slave, or
instrument; than which nothing can be more senseless and absurd: for
the fourth, thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself; for that
thou doest suffer that more divine part in thee, to become subject and
obnoxious to that more ignoble part of thy body, and the gross lusts
and concupiscences thereof.

 What portion soever, either of air or fire there be in thee,
although by nature it tend upwards, submitting nevertheless to the
ordinance of the universe, it abides here below in this mixed body. So
whatsoever is in thee, either earthy, or humid, although by nature it
tend downwards, yet is it against its nature both raised upwards, and
standing, or consistent. So obedient are even the elements themselves to
the universe, abiding patiently wheresoever (though against their
nature) they are placed, until the sound as it were of their retreat,
and separation. Is it not a grievous thing then, that thy reasonable
part only should be disobedient, and should not endure to keep its
place: yea though it be nothing enjoined that is contrary unto it, but
that only which is according to its nature? For we cannot say of it when
it is disobedient, as we say of the fire, or air, that it tends upwards
towards its proper element, for then goes it the quite contrary way. For
the motion of the mind to any injustice, or incontinency, or to sorrow,
or to fear, is nothing else but a separation from nature. Also when the
mind is grieved for anything that is happened by the divine providence,
then doth it likewise forsake its own place. For it was ordained unto
holiness and godliness, which specially consist in an humble submission
to God and His providence in all things; as well as unto justice: these
also being part of those duties, which as naturally sociable, we are
bound unto; and without which we cannot happily converse one with
another: yea and the very ground and fountain indeed of all just
actions.

 He that hath not one and the self-same general end always as long
as he liveth, cannot possibly be one and the self-same man always. But
this will not suffice except thou add also what ought to be this general
end. For as the general conceit and apprehension of all those things
which upon no certain ground are by the greater part of men deemed good,
cannot be uniform and agreeable, but that only which is limited and
restrained by some certain proprieties and conditions, as of community:
that nothing be conceived good, which is not commonly and publicly
good: so must the end also that we propose unto ourselves, be common
and sociable. For he that doth direct all his own private motions and
purposes to that end, all his actions will be agreeable and uniform; and
by that means will be still the same man.

 Remember the fable of the country mouse and the city mouse, and the
great fright and terror that this was put into.

 Socrates was wont to call the common conceits and opinions of men,
the common bugbears of the world: the proper terror of silly children.

 The Lacedæmonians at their public spectacles were wont to appoint
seats and forms for their strangers in the shadow, they themselves were
content to sit anywhere.

 What Socrates answered unto Perdiccas, why he did not come unto
him, Lest of all deaths I should die the worst kind of death, said he:
that is, not able to requite the good that hath been done unto me.

 In the ancient mystical letters of the Ephesians, there was an
item, that a man should always have in his mind some one or other of the
ancient worthies.

 The Pythagoreans were wont betimes in the morning the first thing
they did, to look up unto the heavens, to put themselves in mind of them
who constantly and invariably did perform their task: as also to put
themselves in mind of orderliness, or good order, and of purity, and of
naked simplicity. For no star or planet hath any cover before it.

 How Socrates looked, when he was fain to gird himself with a
skin, Xanthippe his wife having taken away his clothes, and carried them
abroad with her, and what he said to his fellows and friends, who were
ashamed; and out of respect to him, did retire themselves when they saw
him thus decked.

 In matter of writing or reading thou must needs be taught before
thou can do either: much more in matter of life. 'For thou art born a
mere slave, to thy senses and brutish affections;' destitute without
teaching of all true knowledge and sound reason.

 'My heart smiled within me.' 'They will accuse even virtue
herself; with heinous and opprobrious words.'

 As they that long after figs in winter when they cannot be had; so
are they that long after children, before they be granted them.

 'As often as a father kisseth his child, he should say secretly
with himself' (said Epictetus,) 'tomorrow perchance shall he die.' But
these words be ominous. No words ominous (said he) that signify anything
that is natural: in very truth and deed not more ominous than this, 'to
cut down grapes when they are ripe.' Green grapes, ripe grapes, dried
grapes, or raisins: so many changes and mutations of one thing, not into
that which was not absolutely, but rather so many several changes and
mutations, not into that which hath no being at all, but into that which
is not yet in being.

 'Of the free will there is no thief or robber:' out of Epictetus;
Whose is this also: that we should find a certain art and method of
assenting; and that we should always observe with great care and heed
the inclinations of our minds, that they may always be with their due
restraint and reservation, always charitable, and according to the
true worth of every present object. And as for earnest longing, that we
should altogether avoid it: and to use averseness in those things only,
that wholly depend of our own wills. It is not about ordinary petty
matters, believe it, that all our strife and contention is, but whether,
with the vulgar, we should be mad, or by the help of philosophy wise and
sober, said he.  Socrates said, 'What will you have? the souls of
reasonable, or unreasonable creatures? Of reasonable. But what? Of those
whose reason is sound and perfect? or of those whose reason is vitiated
and corrupted? Of those whose reason is sound and perfect. Why then
labour ye not for such? Because we have them already. What then do ye so
strive and contend between you?'

 Whatsoever thou doest hereafter aspire unto, thou mayest even now
enjoy and possess, if thou doest not envy thyself thine own happiness.
And that will be, if thou shalt forget all that is past, and for the
future, refer thyself wholly to the Divine Providence, and shalt bend
and apply all thy present thoughts and intentions to holiness and
righteousness. To holiness, in accepting willingly whatsoever is sent
by the Divine Providence, as being that which the nature of the universe
hath appointed unto thee, which also hath appointed thee for that,
whatsoever it be. To righteousness, in speaking the truth freely, and
without ambiguity; and in doing all things justly and discreetly. Now in
this good course, let not other men's either wickedness, or opinion, or
voice hinder thee: no, nor the sense of this thy pampered mass of flesh:
for let that which suffers, look to itself. If therefore whensoever the
time of thy departing shall come, thou shalt readily leave all things,
and shalt respect thy mind only, and that divine part of thine, and this
shall be thine only fear, not that some time or other thou shalt cease
to live, but thou shalt never begin to live according to nature: then
shalt thou be a man indeed, worthy of that world, from which thou hadst
thy beginning; then shalt thou cease to be a stranger in thy country,
and to wonder at those things that happen daily, as things strange and
unexpected, and anxiously to depend of divers things that are not in thy
power.

 God beholds our minds and understandings, bare and naked from these
material vessels, and outsides, and all earthly dross. For with His
simple and pure understanding, He pierceth into our inmost and purest
parts, which from His, as it were by a water pipe and channel, first
flowed and issued. This if thou also shalt use to do, thou shalt
rid thyself of that manifold luggage, wherewith thou art round about
encumbered. For he that does regard neither his body, nor his clothing,
nor his dwelling, nor any such external furniture, must needs gain unto
himself great rest and ease. Three things there be in all, which thou
doest consist of; thy body, thy life, and thy mind. Of these the two
former, are so far forth thine, as that thou art bound to take care for
them. But the third alone is that which is properly thine. If then thou
shalt separate from thyself, that is from thy mind, whatsoever other men
either do or say, or whatsoever thou thyself hast heretofore either
done or said; and all troublesome thoughts concerning the future, and
whatsoever, (as either belonging to thy body or life:) is without the
jurisdiction of thine own will, and whatsoever in the ordinary course
of human chances and accidents doth happen unto thee; so that thy
mind (keeping herself loose and free from all outward coincidental
entanglements; always in a readiness to depart:) shall live by herself,
and to herself, doing that which is just, accepting whatsoever doth
happen, and speaking the truth always; if, I say, thou shalt separate
from thy mind, whatsoever by sympathy might adhere unto it, and all time
both past and future, and shalt make thyself in all points and respects,
like unto Empedocles his allegorical sphere, 'all round and circular,'
&c., and shalt think of no longer life than that which is now present:
then shalt thou be truly able to pass the remainder of thy days without
troubles and distractions; nobly and generously disposed, and in good
favour and correspondency, with that spirit which is within thee.

 I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man
loving himself best, should more regard other men's opinions concerning
himself than his own. For if any God or grave master standing by,
should command any of us to think nothing by himself but what he should
presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, though but for one
day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, than
what we ourselves.

 how come it to pass that the Gods having ordered all other things
so well and so lovingly, should be overseen in this one only thing, that
whereas then hath been some very good men that have made many covenants
as it were with God and by many holy actions and outward services
contracted a kind of familiarity with Him; that these men when once they
are dead, should never be restored to life, but be extinct for ever. But
this thou mayest be sure of, that this (if it be so indeed) would
never have been so ordered by the Gods, had it been fit otherwise. For
certainly it was possible, had it been more just so and had it been
according to nature, the nature of the universe would easily have borne
it. But now because it is not so, (if so be that it be not so indeed) be
therefore confident that it was not fit it should be so for thou seest
thyself, that now seeking after this matter, how freely thou doest argue
and contest with God. But were not the Gods both just and good in the
highest degree, thou durst not thus reason with them. Now if just and
good, it could not be that in the creation of the world, they should
either unjustly or unreasonably oversee anything.

 Use thyself even unto those things that thou doest at first despair
of. For the left hand we see, which for the most part lieth idle because
not used; yet doth it hold the bridle with more strength than the right,
because it hath been used unto it.

 Let these be the objects of thy ordinary meditation: to consider,
what manner of men both for soul and body we ought to be, whensoever
death shall surprise us: the shortness of this our mortal life: the
immense vastness of the time that hath been before, and will he after
us: the frailty of every worldly material object: all these things to
consider, and behold clearly in themselves, all disguisement of external
outside being removed and taken away. Again, to consider the efficient
causes of all things: the proper ends and references of all actions:
what pain is in itself; what pleasure, what death: what fame or
honour, how every man is the true and proper ground of his own rest and
tranquillity, and that no man can truly be hindered by any other: that
all is but conceit and opinion. As for the use of thy dogmata, thou must
carry thyself in the practice of them, rather like unto a pancratiastes,
or one that at the same time both fights and wrestles with hands and
feet, than a gladiator. For this, if he lose his sword that he fights
with, he is gone: whereas the other hath still his hand free, which he
may easily turn and manage at his will.

 All worldly things thou must behold and consider, dividing them
into matter, form, and reference, or their proper end.

 How happy is man in this his power that hath been granted unto
him: that he needs not do anything but what God shall approve, and
that he may embrace contentedly, whatsoever God doth send unto him?

 Whatsoever doth happen in the ordinary course and consequence of
natural events, neither the Gods, (for it is not possible, that they
either wittingly or unwittingly should do anything amiss) nor men, (for
it is through ignorance, and therefore against their wills that they do
anything amiss) must be accused. None then must be accused.

 How ridiculous and strange is he, that wonders at anything that
happens in this life in the ordinary course of nature!

 Either fate, (and that either an absolute necessity, and unavoidable
decree; or a placable and flexible Providence) or all is a mere
casual confusion, void of all order and government. If an absolute and
unavoidable necessity, why doest thou resist? If a placable and exorable
Providence, make thyself worthy of the divine help and assistance. If
all be a mere confusion without any moderator, or governor, then hast
thou reason to congratulate thyself; that in such a general flood of
confusion thou thyself hast obtained a reasonable faculty, whereby thou
mayest govern thine own life and actions. But if thou beest carried
away with the flood, it must be thy body perchance, or thy life, or some
other thing that belongs unto them that is carried away: thy mind and
understanding cannot. Or should it be so, that the light of a candle
indeed is still bright and lightsome until it be put out: and should
truth, and righteousness, and temperance cease to shine in thee whilest
thou thyself hast any being?

 At the conceit and apprehension that such and such a one hath
sinned, thus reason with thyself; What do I know whether this be a sin
indeed, as it seems to be? But if it be, what do I know but that he
himself hath already condemned himself for it? And that is all one as
if a man should scratch and tear his own face, an object of compassion
rather than of anger. Again, that he that would not have a vicious man
to sin, is like unto him that would not have moisture in the fig, nor
children to welp nor a horse to neigh, nor anything else that in the
course of nature is necessary. For what shall he do that hath such an
habit? If thou therefore beest powerful and eloquent, remedy it if thou
canst.

 If it be not fitting, do it not. If it be not true, speak it not.
Ever maintain thine own purpose and resolution free from all compulsion
and necessity.

 Of everything that presents itself unto thee, to consider what the
true nature of it is, and to unfold it, as it were, by dividing it into
that which is formal: that which is material: the true use or end of it,
and the just time that it is appointed to last.

 It is high time for thee, to understand that there is somewhat in
thee, better and more divine than either thy passions, or thy sensual
appetites and affections. What is now the object of my mind, is it fear,
or suspicion, or lust, or any such thing? To do nothing rashly without
some certain end; let that be thy first care. The next, to have no other
end than the common good. For, alas! yet a little while, and thou art no
more: no more will any, either of those things that now thou seest, or
of those men that now are living, be any more. For all things are by
nature appointed soon to be changed, turned, and corrupted, that other
things might succeed in their room.

 Remember that all is but opinion, and all opinion depends of the
mind. Take thine opinion away, and then as a ship that hath stricken
in within the arms and mouth of the harbour, a present calm; all things
safe and steady: a bay, not capable of any storms and tempests: as the
poet hath it.

 No operation whatsoever it he, ceasing for a while, can be truly
said to suffer any evil, because it is at an end. Neither can he that
is the author of that operation; for this very respect, because his
operation is at an end, be said to suffer any evil. Likewise then,
neither can the whole body of all our actions (which is our life) if in
time it cease, be said to suffer any evil for this very reason, because
it is at an end; nor he truly be said to have been ill affected, that
did put a period to this series of actions. Now this time or certain
period, depends of the determination of nature: sometimes of particular
nature, as when a man dieth old; but of nature in general, however; the
parts whereof thus changing one after another, the whole world still
continues fresh and new. Now that is ever best and most seasonable,
which is for the good of the whole. Thus it appears that death of
itself can neither be hurtful to any in particular, because it is not a
shameful thing (for neither is it a thing that depends of our own will,
nor of itself contrary to the common good) and generally, as it is both
expedient and seasonable to the whole, that in that respect it must
needs be good. It is that also, which is brought unto us by the order
and appointment of the Divine Providence; so that he whose will and
mind in these things runs along with the Divine ordinance, and by this
concurrence of his will and mind with the Divine Providence, is led
and driven along, as it were by God Himself; may truly be termed and
esteemed the θεοφόρητος, or divinely led and inspired.

 These three things thou must have always in a readiness: first
concerning thine own actions, whether thou doest nothing either idly,
or otherwise, than justice and equity do require: and concerning those
things that happen unto thee externally, that either they happen unto
thee by chance, or by providence; of which two to accuse either, is
equally against reason. Secondly, what like unto our bodies are
whilest yet rude and imperfect, until they be animated: and from their
animation, until their expiration: of what things they are compounded,
and into what things they shall be dissolved. Thirdly, how vain all
things will appear unto thee when, from on high as it were, looking
down thou shalt contemplate all things upon earth, and the wonderful
mutability, that they are subject unto: considering withal, the infinite
both greatness and variety of things aerial and things celestial that
are round about it. And that as often as thou shalt behold them, thou
shalt still see the same: as the same things, so the same shortness of
continuance of all those things. And, behold, these be the things that
we are so proud and puffed up for.

 Cast away from thee opinion, and thou art safe. And what is it that
hinders thee from casting of it away? When thou art grieved at anything,
hast thou forgotten that all things happen according to the nature
of the universe; and that him only it concerns, who is in fault; and
moreover, that what is now done, is that which from ever hath been done
in the world, and will ever be done, and is now done everywhere: how
nearly all men are allied one to another by a kindred not of blood, nor
of seed, but of the same mind. Thou hast also forgotten that every man's
mind partakes of the Deity, and issueth from thence; and that no man can
properly call anything his own, no not his son, nor his body, nor his
life; for that they all proceed from that One who is the giver of all
things: that all things are but opinion; that no man lives properly, but
that very instant of time which is now present. And therefore that no
man whensoever he dieth can properly be said to lose any more, than an
instant of time.

 Let thy thoughts ever run upon them, who once for some one thing or
other, were moved with extraordinary indignation; who were once in
the highest pitch of either honour, or calamity; or mutual hatred and
enmity; or of any other fortune or condition whatsoever. Then consider
what's now become of all those things. All is turned to smoke; all to
ashes, and a mere fable; and perchance not so much as a fable. As also
whatsoever is of this nature, as Fabius Catulinus in the field; Lucius
Lupus, and Stertinius, at Baiæ Tiberius at Capreæ and Velius Rufus,
and all such examples of vehement prosecution in worldly matters; let
these also run in thy mind at the same time; and how vile every object
of such earnest and vehement prosecution is; and how much more agreeable
to true philosophy it is, for a man to carry himself in every matter
that offers itself; justly, and moderately, as one that followeth the
Gods with all simplicity. For, for a man to be proud and high conceited,
that he is not proud and high conceited, is of all kind of pride and
presumption, the most intolerable.

 To them that ask thee, Where hast thou seen the Gods, or how
knowest thou certainly that there be Gods, that thou art so devout in
their worship? I answer first of all, that even to the very eye, they
are in some manner visible and apparent. Secondly, neither have I ever
seen mine own soul, and yet I respect and honour it. So then for the
Gods, by the daily experience that I have of their power and providence
towards myself and others, I know certainly that they are, and therefore
worship them.

 Herein doth consist happiness of life, for a man to know
thoroughly the true nature of everything; what is the matter, and what
is the form of it: with all his heart and soul, ever to do that which is
just, and to speak the truth. What then remaineth but to enjoy thy life
in a course and coherence of good actions, one upon another immediately
succeeding, and never interrupted, though for never so little a while?

 There is but one light of the sun, though it be intercepted by
walls and mountains, and other thousand objects. There is but one common
substance of the whole world, though it be concluded and restrained into
several different bodies, in number infinite. There is but one common
soul, though divided into innumerable particular essences and natures.
So is there but one common intellectual soul, though it seem to be
divided. And as for all other parts of those generals which we have
mentioned, as either sensitive souls or subjects, these of themselves
(as naturally irrational) have no common mutual reference one unto
another, though many of them contain a mind, or reasonable faculty in
them, whereby they are ruled and governed. But of every reasonable mind,
this the particular nature, that it hath reference to whatsoever is
of her own kind, and desireth to be united: neither can this common
affection, or mutual unity and correspondency, be here intercepted or
divided, or confined to particulars as those other common things are.

 What doest thou desire? To live long. What? To enjoy the
operations of a sensitive soul; or of the appetitive faculty? or wouldst
thou grow, and then decrease again? Wouldst thou long be able to talk,
to think and reason with thyself? Which of all these seems unto thee a
worthy object of thy desire? Now if of all these thou doest find that
they be but little worth in themselves, proceed on unto the last, which
is, in all things to follow God and reason. But for a man to grieve that
by death he shall be deprived of any of these things, is both against
God and reason.

 What a small portion of vast and infinite eternity it is, that is
allowed unto every one of us, and how soon it vanisheth into the general
age of the world: of the common substance, and of the common soul also
what a small portion is allotted unto us: and in what a little clod of
the whole earth (as it were) it is that thou doest crawl. After thou
shalt rightly have considered these things with thyself; fancy not
anything else in the world any more to be of any weight and moment
but this, to do that only which thine own nature doth require; and to
conform thyself to that which the common nature doth afford.

 What is the present estate of my understanding? For herein lieth
all indeed. As for all other things, they are without the compass of
mine own will: and if without the compass of my will, then are they as
dead things unto me, and as it were mere smoke.

 To stir up a man to the contempt of death this among other
things, is of good power and efficacy, that even they who esteemed
pleasure to be happiness, and pain misery, did nevertheless many of them
contemn death as much as any. And can death be terrible to him, to
whom that only seems good, which in the ordinary course of nature is
seasonable? to him, to whom, whether his actions be many or few, so they
be all good, is all one; and who whether he behold the things of the
world being always the same either for many years, or for few years
only, is altogether indifferent? O man! as a citizen thou hast lived,
and conversed in this great city the world. Whether just for so many
years, or no, what is it unto thee? Thou hast lived (thou mayest be
sure) as long as the laws and orders of the city required; which may be
the common comfort of all. Why then should it be grievous unto thee, if
(not a tyrant, nor an unjust judge, but) the same nature that brought
thee in, doth now send thee out of the world? As if the praetor should
fairly dismiss him from the stage, whom he had taken in to act a while.
Oh, but the play is not yet at an end, there are but three acts yet
acted of it? Thou hast well said: for in matter of life, three acts is
the whole play. Now to set a certain time to every man's acting, belongs
unto him only, who as first he was of thy composition, so is now the
cause of thy dissolution. As for thyself; thou hast to do with
neither. Go thy ways then well pleased and contented: for so is He that
dismisseth thee.

## SECOND BOOK: DISCOURSES 
 In general, you will nd no art or faculty that can analyse itself,
therefore none that can approve or disapprove of itself.  The art
of grammar is restricted to analysing and commenting on literature.
Music is conned to the analysis of harmony.  Consequently
neither of them analyses itself. Now, if you are writing to a friend,
the art of grammar will help you decide what words to use; but it
will not tell you whether it is a good idea to write to your friend in
the rst place. Music is no dierent; whether this is a good time to
sing and play, or a bad one, the art of music by itself cannot decide.
 So what can? The faculty that analyses itself as well as the
others, namely, the faculty of reason. Reason is unique among the
faculties assigned to us in being able to evaluate itself – what it is,
what it is capable of, how valuable it is – in addition to passing
judgement on others.
 What decides whether a sum of money is good? The money is
not going to tell you; it must be the faculty that makes use of such
impressions – reason.  Reason, in addition, takes the measure of
music, grammar and the other arts, judging their benet and
deciding when it’s best to use them.
 So it’s only appropriate that the gods have given us the best
and most ecacious gift: the ability to make good use of
impressions. Other capacities they did not put in our power.  Was
it because they did not want to? Personally, I believe that they
would have endowed us with those others too, had they been able.
But they were not.  Since we are on earth, you see, bound to a
material body and material things, we can hardly avoid being
limited by these extraneous factors.
 Well, what does Zeus say? ‘Epictetus, if it were possible, I
would have made your little body and possessions both free and
unrestricted.  As it is, though, make no mistake: this body does
not belong to you, it is only cunningly constructed clay.  And
since I could not make the body yours, I have given you a portion of
myself instead, the power of positive and negative impulse, of desire
and aversion – the power, in other words, of making good use of
impressions. If you take care of it and identify with it, you will
never be blocked or frustrated; you won’t have to complain, and
never will need to blame or atter anyone.  Is that enough to
satisfy you?’
‘It’s more than enough. Thank you.’
 And yet, while there is only the one thing we can care for
and devote ourselves to, we choose instead to care about and attach
ourselves to a score of others: to our bodies, to our property, to our
family, friends and slaves.  And, being attached to many things,
we are weighed down and dragged along with them.  If the
weather keeps us from travelling, we sit down, fret, and keep
asking, ‘Which way is the wind blowing?’ ‘From the north.’ ‘That’s
no good. When will it blow from the west?’ ‘When it wants to, or
rather when Aeolus wants it to; because God put Aeolus in charge of
the winds, not you.’  What should we do then? Make the best
use of what is in our power, and treat the rest in accordance with its
nature. And what is its nature? However God decides.
 ‘Must I be beheaded now, and alone?’ Well, do you want
everyone to be beheaded just because misery loves company? 
Why not hold out your neck the way Lateranus did at Rome, when
condemned by Nero to be beheaded? He held out his neck willingly
to take the blow – but the blow was decient, so he recoiled a bit,
but then had enough self-command to oer his neck a second time.
 And prior to that, when Epaphroditus, Nero’s freedman,
approached a certain man and asked him about the grounds of his
oence, he replied, ‘If I want anything, I will tell it to your master.’1
 What should we have ready at hand in a situation like this?
The knowledge of what is mine and what is not mine, what I can
and cannot do.  I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be
put in chains – but moaning and groaning too? I must be exiled; but
is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and selfcomposed?
‘Tell us your secrets.’
 ‘I refuse, as this is up to me.’
‘I will put you in chains.’
‘What’s that you say, friend? It’s only my leg you will chain, not
even God can conquer my will.’
 ‘I will throw you into prison.’
‘Correction – it is my body you will throw there.’
‘I will behead you.’
‘Well, when did I ever claim that mine was the only neck that
couldn’t be severed?’
 That’s the kind of attitude you need to cultivate if you would
be a philosopher, the sort of sentiments you should write down
every day and put in practice.
 Thrasea used to say, ‘I would sooner be killed today than
banished tomorrow.’2  And what did Musonius say to him? ‘If
you choose death because it is the greater evil, what sense is there
in that? Or if you choose it as the lesser evil, remember who gave
you the choice. Why not try coming to terms with what you have
been given?’
 Agrippinus used to say, ‘I don’t add to my troubles.’ To
illustrate, someone once said to him, ‘You are being tried in the
Senate –  good luck.’ But it was eleven in the morning, and at
that hour he was in the habit of taking his bath and exercise. ‘Let us
be o to exercise.’  When he was done, word came that he had
been condemned. ‘To exile,’ he asked, ‘or death?’ ‘Exile.’ ‘And my
estate, what about that?’ ‘It has not been conscated.’ ‘Well then, let
us go to my villa in Aricia and have lunch there.’  This shows
what is possible when we practise what is necessary, and make our
desire and aversion safe against any setback or adversity.  ‘I
have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will
take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I
will tend to later.’ How? As someone who knows that you have to
return what belongs to somebody else.
I 2 How a person can preserve their proper character in any
situation
 Man, the rational animal, can put up with anything except what
seems to him irrational; whatever is rational is tolerable. 
Physical hardships are not intolerable by nature. The Spartans, for
instance, gladly submit to being whipped because they are taught
that it is done for good reason.  But what about being hanged –
isn’t that intolerable? Well, people frequently go and hang
themselves, whenever they judge that it is a reasonable course of
action.
 In short, reection will show that people are put o by
nothing so much as what they think is unreasonable, and attracted
to nothing more than what to them seems reasonable.
 But standards of reasonableness and unreasonableness vary
from one person to the next – just as we consider dierent things
good or bad, harmful or benecial.  Which is why education has
no goal more important than bringing our preconception of what is
reasonable and unreasonable in alignment with nature.
 But this not only involves weighing the value of externals, it
also means considering what agrees with our own, individual
nature.  For one person it is reasonable to be a bathroom
attendant, because he only thinks about what punishment and
privation lie in wait for him otherwise, and knows that if he accepts
the assignment he will be spared that pain and hardship. 
Someone else not only nds such a job intolerable for him
personally, but nds it intolerable that anyone should have to
perform it.  But ask me, ‘Shall I be a bathroom attendant or
not?’ and I will tell you that earning a living is better than starving
to death; so that if you measure your interests by these criteria, go
ahead and do it.  ‘But it would be beneath my dignity.’ Well,
that is an additional factor that you bring to the question, not me.
You are the one who knows yourself – which is to say, you know
how much you are worth in your own estimation, and therefore at
what price you will sell yourself; because people sell themselves at
dierent rates.
 So, for instance, Agrippinus told Florus to ‘Go ahead’ when
he was debating whether to attend Nero’s festival, maybe even
participate.  But when Florus asked him why he was not going
himself, Agrippinus answered, ‘I don’t even consider the possibility.’
 Taking account of the value of externals, you see, comes at
some cost to the value of one’s own character.
 So if you want to know if life or death is better, the answer I
give is, ‘Life.’  If you ask about pain versus pleasure, I say,
‘Pleasure is preferable.’
‘But if I refuse to participate in Nero’s festival, he will kill me.’
 Go ahead and participate, then – but I still refuse.
‘Why?’
Because you think of yourself as no more than a single thread in
the robe, whose duty it is to conform to the mass of people – just as
a single white thread seemingly has no wish to clash with the
remainder of the garment.  But I aspire to be the purple stripe,
that is, the garment’s brilliant hem. However small a part it may be,
it can still manage to make the garment as a whole attractive. Don’t
tell me, then, ‘Be like the rest,’ because in that case I cannot be the
purple stripe.3
 In his actions Helvidius Priscus showed his awareness of this
principle. When Emperor Vespasian sent him word barring him from
the Senate, his response was, ‘You can disqualify me as a senator.
But as long as I do remain a member I must join the assembly.’ 
‘Well join, then, but don’t say anything.’ ‘Don’t call on me for my
vote and I won’t say anything.’ ‘But I must call on you for your
vote.’ ‘And I have to give whatever answer I think is right.’ 
‘Answer, and I will kill you.’ ‘Did I ever say I was immortal? You do
your part, and I will do mine. It is your part to kill me, mine to die
without inching; your part to exile me, mine to leave without
protest.’
 And what did Priscus accomplish, who was but a single
man? Well, what good does the purple stripe do the robe? Its lustre
is a good example to the rest.  If it had been someone else in the
same situation whom the emperor barred from entering the Senate,
he would have probably said, ‘I’m so grateful you can spare me.’
 In fact, the emperor would not have even bothered to bar him,
well aware that the man would either sit there like a blockhead or,
if he did speak, would only mouth words he knew that Caesar
wanted to hear – and would pile additional inanities on besides.
 A certain athlete, at risk of dying unless his genitals were
amputated, made a comparable choice. His brother, a philosopher,
went and asked him, ‘Well, my brother, what’s it going to be? Will
you have them amputated, and return to life in the gymnasium?’
The man refused to submit to the indignity, however, and
summoned the will to die.  Someone asked, ‘Did he choose
death as an athlete or as a philosopher?’ ‘As a man,’ Epictetus said,
‘one who had competed at the level of the Olympic Games, where
he was a familiar gure, and a victor more than once – no
occasional visitor to the local gym.  Someone else might have
even allowed his head to be removed, if his life could have been
saved thereby.  That’s what I mean by having consideration for
one’s character. And it shows how weighty a factor it can be when it
is allowed a regular role in one’s deliberations.
 ‘Come, Epictetus, shave o your beard.’
If I am a philosopher, I will not shave it o.
‘But I will cut o your head.’
If that will do you any good, then cut it o.
 Someone asked, ‘But how do we know what is in keeping
with our character?’
Well, how does the bull realize its own strength, rushing out to
protect the whole herd when a lion attacks? The possession of a
particular talent is instinctively sensed by its owner;  so if any
of you are so blessed you will be the rst to know it.  It is true,
however, that no bull reaches maturity in an instant, nor do men
become heroes overnight. We must endure a winter training, and
can’t be dashing into situations for which we aren’t yet prepared.
 Consider at what price you sell your integrity; but please, for
God’s sake, don’t sell it cheap. The grand gesture, the ultimate
sacrice – that, perhaps, belongs to others, to people of Socrates’
class.  ‘But if we are endowed by nature with the potential for
greatness, why do only some of us achieve it?’ Well, do all horses
become stallions? Are all dogs greyhounds?  Even if I lack the
talent, I will not abandon the eort on that account.  Epictetus
will not be better than Socrates. But if I am no worse, I am satised.
 I mean, I will never be Milo either; nevertheless, I don’t neglect
my body. Nor will I be another Croesus – and still, I don’t neglect
my property. In short, we do not abandon any discipline for despair
of ever being the best in it.
I 3 How to draw the correct consequences from the fact
that God is the father of mankind
 If we could completely subscribe, as we should, to the view that
we are all primary creatures of God, and that God is father of both
gods and men, I don’t believe that we would ever think mean or
lowly thoughts about ourselves.  If the emperor adopts you, no
one will be able to put up with your pretension; but knowing that
you are the son of God, shouldn’t your pride be that much greater?
 In fact, though, we react quite dierently. Two elements are
combined in our creation, the body, which we have in common with
the beasts; and reason and good judgement, which we share with
the gods. Most of us tend toward the former connection, miserable
and mortal though it is, whereas only a few favour this holy and
blessed alliance.
 Since everyone will necessarily treat things in accordance
with their beliefs about them, those few who think that they are
born for delity, respect and condence in their use of impressions
entertain no mean or ignoble thoughts about themselves, while the
majority does the opposite.  ‘What am I? A wretched mortal – a
feeble piece of esh.’  Feeble indeed – but you have something
better than the esh. So why turn away from this and cling to that?
 Because of this connection, some of us sink to the level of
wolves – faithless, vicious and treacherous. Others turn into lions –
wild, savage and uncivilized. But most of us become like foxes, the
sorriest of the lot.  For what else is a spiteful, malicious man
except a fox, or something even lower and less dignied?
 See that you don’t turn out like one of those unfortunates.
I 4 On progress
 Whoever is making progress, after learning from philosophers
that desire is directed toward good things and avoidance directed
toward bad, and having also learned that impassivity and a good
ow of life are not attained except through unerring desire and
unfailing avoidance – that person will do away with desire
altogether, or else defer it to another time, and exercise avoidance
only on things within the moral sphere.  Because they know that
if they try to avoid anything outside the moral sphere they are going
to run into something contrary to their aversion and face disaster.
 But if virtue holds this promise – to secure happiness,
impassivity, and a good ow of life – then progress toward virtue
must involve progress toward these other states as well.  For
wherever the perfection of anything tends, progress is always an
approach towards the same thing.
 So how is it that, although we are now agreed about the
nature of virtue, we still try to demonstrate progress in areas that
are unrelated? What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that
ows smoothly?  So who is making progress – the person who
has read many of Chrysippus’ books?  Is virtue no more than this
– to become literate in Chrysippus? Because, if that’s what it is, then
progress cannot amount to anything more than learning as much
Chrysippus as we can.  We are agreed, however, that virtue
produces one thing, while maintaining that the approach to it,
progress, results in something dierent.  ‘This person can read
Chrysippus already by himself. You are making progress, by God,’
someone says sarcastically. ‘Some progress that is!’  ‘Why do
you make fun of him?’ ‘Well, why do you try to distract him from
coming to an awareness of his faults?’ Don’t you want to show him
the purpose of virtue, so that he will know what real progress
consists in?  Look for it in your volition, friend – that is, in your
desire and avoidance. Make it your goal never to fail in your desires
or experience things you would rather avoid; try never to err in
impulse and repulsion; aim to be perfect also in the practice of
attention and withholding judgement.  But the rst subjects are
the most essential. If you aim to be perfect when you are still
anxious and apprehensive, how have you made progress?  So
let’s see some evidence of it. But no, it’s as if I were to say to an
athlete, ‘Show me your shoulders,’ and he responded with, ‘Have a
look at my weights.’ ‘Get out of here with you and your gigantic
weights!’ I’d say, ‘What I want to see isn’t the weights but how
you’ve proted from using them.’
 ‘Take the treatise On Impulse and see how well I’ve read it.’
Idiot. It’s not that I’m after, I want to know how you put impulse
and repulsion into practice, and desire and avoidance as well. I want
to know how you apply and prepare yourself, and how you practise
attention,∗ so that I can decide whether with you these functions
operate in harmony with nature.  If you are, in fact, acting in
accord with nature, then show me, and I will be the rst to say that
you are making progress. But otherwise, be o, and rather than just
comment on books, you might as well go write one yourself. But, in
the end, what good will it do you?  You know that a whole
book costs around ve denarii.4
Is the commentator, then, worth
more than that?  Don’t put your purpose in one place and
expect to see progress made somewhere else.
 Where is progress, then? If there is anyone who renounces
externals and attends instead to their character, cultivating and
perfecting it so that it agrees with nature, making it honest and
trustworthy, elevated, free, unchecked and undeterred;  and if
they’ve learned that whoever desires or avoids things outside their
control cannot be free or faithful, but has to shift and uctuate right
along with them, subject to anyone with the power to furnish or
deprive them of these externals;  and if from the moment they
get up in the morning they adhere to their ideals, eating and
bathing like a person of integrity, putting their principles into
practice in every situation they face – the way a runner does when
he applies the principles of running, or a singer those of
musicianship  – that is where you will see true progress
embodied, and nd someone who has not wasted their time making
the journey here from home.
 But anyone whose sole passion is reading books, and who
does little else besides, having moved here for this – my advice for
them is to go back home immediately and attend to business there,
 because they left home for nothing. A student should practise
how to expunge from his life sighs and sorrow, grief and
disappointment, exclamations like ‘poor me’ and ‘alas’;  he
should learn what death is, as well as exile, jail and hemlock, so at
the end of the day he can say, like Socrates in prison, ‘Dear Crito, if
it pleases the gods, so be it,’5 – instead of, ‘Poor me, an old man – is
this what old age held in store for me?’  Don’t imagine that I am
referring to anyone humble or obscure, either; Priam says it, so does
Oedipus. In fact, all the kings of legend can be found saying it. 
For what else are tragedies but the ordeals of people who have come
to value externals, tricked out in tragic verse?
 If I had to be deceived into believing that externals, which
lie outside our power, are not man’s proper concern, personally I
would consent to such a deception, provided it really could enable
me to live an untroubled life, in peace of mind. Which condition you
prefer you can determine for yourself.
 What does Chrysippus give us? ‘To make certain,’ he says,
‘that these doctrines promising freedom from passion and serenity
are legitimate,  take all my books,∗ and you will nd that the
knowledge that makes me impassive is faithful to, and in accord
with, nature.’ How lucky we are! A benefactor – and how great a
benefactor! – has shown us the way.6  Men have erected altars
to Triptolemus7
for giving us the art of farming;  but the man
who found, disclosed and explained the truth to everyone – not the
truth that pertains just to living, but to living well – who among you
ever raised an altar, built a temple, erected a statue or venerated
God for that?  We oer the gods sacrice because they gave us
wheat and wine. But they have produced such wonderful fruit in a
human mind, as part of their plan to bestow on humanity the true
secret of happiness. Are we going to forget to express our gratitude
to them on that account?
I 5 Against the Sceptics8
 If a man objects to truths that are all too evident, it is no easy
task nding arguments that will change his mind.  This is proof
neither of his own strength nor of his teacher’s weakness. When
someone caught in an argument hardens to stone, there is just no
more reasoning with them.
 Now, a person can suer two kinds of petrifaction,9
 that of the
intellect, and that of the sense of honour, when somebody assumes a
deant stance, resolved neither to assent to self-evident truths nor
leave o ghting.  Most of us dread the deadening of the body
and will do anything to avoid it. About the deadening of the soul,
however, we don’t care one iota.  Even in the case of the soul, we
regard a man as pitiable if he is decient in thinking or learning. We
pity the mentally retarded, and students with learning diculties.
But if somebody’s sense of shame and respect are dead, we will
actually call this determination.
 ‘Do you realize that you are awake?’
‘No, any more than when I dream and have the impression that I
am awake.’
‘And is the one impression in no way dierent from the other?’
‘No.’
 Can I go on reasoning with such a person? What re or iron
can be applied to him, to make him conscious of his condition? He
senses it, but pretends he doesn’t; that makes him even worse o
than a corpse.
 One person does not notice a contradiction in his reasoning;
he is unfortunate. Another person notices it, all right, but does not
budge and does not back down; he is even more unfortunate. 
His sense of honour and truthfulness has been excised, and his
reason – not excised, but brutalized. Am I to call this strength of
character? I can’t – any more than I can apply the same name to the
‘strength’ of degenerates that enables them to say and do in public
whatever they please.
I 6 On providence
 It is easy to praise providence for everything that happens in the
world provided you have both the ability to see individual events in
the context of the whole and a sense of gratitude.  Without these,
either you will not see the usefulness of what happens or, even
supposing that you do see it, you will not be grateful for it.
 If God had created colours, but not the faculty of vision,
colours would have been of little use.  Or if God had created
vision, but not made sure that objects could be seen, vision would
have been worthless.  And even if he had made them both, but
not created light –  then neither would have been of any value.
So who contrived this universal accommodation of things to one
another? Who tted the sword to the scabbard and the scabbard to
the sword? No one?  In the case of artifacts, it is just this kind of
symmetry and structure that regularly persuade us that they must be
the work of some artisan, instead of objects created at random. 
Do sword and scabbard testify to their creator, whereas visible
things, vision and light, together, do not?  What about the desire
of the male for sex with the female, and their ability to use the
organs constructed for that purpose – don’t they proclaim their
creator, too?
 All right, then: What about the complex organization of the
mind – built so that, when we meet∗ with sensible objects, we don’t
just have their forms impressed upon us, we make a selection from
among them; and add and subtract impressions to form various
kinds of mental combinations; and from certain ideas make
inferences to others somehow related10 – aren’t such abilities able to
make a big enough impression so that it becomes impossible for us
to discount the possibility of a creator?  If not, it’s left to us to
explain who made them, and how such amazing and craftsmanlike
abilities came into being by accident, on their own.11
 Are humans alone in possession of such skills? It’s true that
there are many skills distinctive to humans, skills that as a rational
animal he uniquely needs. But the irrational animals share with man
many of the same faculties.  Do they also understand what
happens? No – because use is one thing, understanding another. God
needed animals that use impressions, like us; he had special need of
us, though, because we understand their use.12
 And so for the beasts it is enough to eat, drink, sleep, breed
and do whatever else it is that satises members of their kind. But
for us who have been given the faculty of understanding,  this is
not enough. Unless we act appropriately, methodically, and in line
with our nature and constitution, we will fall short of our proper
purpose.  Creatures whose constitutions are dierent have
dierent ends and functions accordingly.  So, for creatures
whose constitution is exclusively designed for use, use on its own
suces; but where the capacity to understand that use is added, the
creature will only reach its end by bringing that capacity into play.
 God created some beasts to be eaten, some to be used in
farming, some to supply us with cheese, and so on. To full such
functions, they don’t need to comprehend impressions or make
distinctions among them.  Man was brought into the world,
however, to look upon God and his works – and not just look, but
appreciate.  And so it is inexcusable for man to begin and end
where the beasts do. He should begin where they do, but only end
where nature left o dealing with him;  which is to say, in
contemplation and understanding, and a manner of life otherwise
adapted to his nature.  Come to look upon and appreciate God’s
works at least once before you die.
 You eagerly travel to Olympia to see the work of Phidias,
and all of you account it a shame to die never having seen the
sight.13  But when there is no need even to travel, when you are
already there∗ because Zeus is present everywhere in his works,
don’t you want to look at and try to understand them?  Will you
never come to a realization of who you are, what you have been
born for and the purpose for which the gift of vision was made in
our case?
 ‘But dicult and disagreeable things happen in life.’ Well,
aren’t diculties found at Olympia? Don’t you get hot? And
crowded? Isn’t bathing a problem? Don’t you get soaked through in
your seats when it rains? Don’t you nally get sick of the noise, the
shouting and the other irritations?  I can only suppose that you
weigh all those negatives against the worth of the show, and choose,
in the end, to be patient and put up with it all.  Furthermore,
you have inner strengths that enable you to bear up with diculties
of every kind. You have been given fortitude, courage and patience.
 Why should I worry about what happens if I am armed with
the virtue of fortitude? Nothing can trouble or upset me, or even
seem annoying. Instead of meeting misfortune with groans and
tears, I will call upon the faculty especially provided to deal with it.
 ‘But my nose is running!’ What do you have hands for, idiot,
if not to wipe it?  ‘But how is it right that there be running
noses in the rst place?’  Instead of thinking up protests,
wouldn’t it be easier just to wipe your nose?
What would have become of Hercules, do you think, if there had
been no lion, hydra, stag or boar – and no savage criminals to rid
the world of?  What would he have done in the absence of such
challenges? Obviouslyhe would have just rolled over in bed and
gone back to sleep. So by snoring his life away in luxury and
comfort he never would have developed into the mighty Hercules.
And even if he had, what good would it have done him?  What
would have been the use of those arms, that physique, and that
noble soul, without crises or conditions to stir him into action?
 ‘In that case, perhaps he should have created them himself,
by searching for a lion to bring into his land, and a boar and a
hydra.’  That would have been the act of a fool and a fanatic.
Still, by showing up and being discovered, they proved useful as
tests of Hercules’ manhood.
 Now that you know all this, come and appreciate the
resources you have, and when that is done, say, ‘Bring on whatever
diculties you like, Zeus; I have resources and a constitution that
you gave me by means of which I can do myself credit whatever
happens.’
 But no. There you sit, worrying that certain events might
happen, already upset and in a state about your present
circumstances. So then you reproach the gods.  What else can
come of such weakness except impiety?  And yet God has not
merely given us strength to tolerate troubles without being
humiliated or undone, but, as betted a king and true father, he has
given them to us free from constraint, compulsion and impediment.
He has put the whole matter in our control, not even reserving to
himself any power to hinder us or stand in our way.  And even
though you have these powers free and entirely your own, you don’t
use them, because you still don’t realize what you have or where it
came from.  Instead you sit crying and complaining – some of
you blind to your benefactor, and unable to acknowledge his
existence; others assailing God with complaints and accusations
from sheer meanness of spirit.
 I am prepared to show you that you have resources and a
character naturally strong and resilient; show me in return what
grounds you have for being peevish and malcontent.
I 7 On the utility of changing arguments,
hypothetical arguments and the rest
 Most people do not realize that practice in changing arguments,
hypothetical arguments, arguments that conclude with a question
and so forth, has a bearing on morals.  For we are interested in
how the good man will act and acquit himself in any situation. 
So let someone say that the virtuous man will spurn question and
answer, or that, if he does engage in it, will be indierent as to
whether he behaves carelessly or at random.  And∗ if we accept
neither alternative, then we have to concede that some study must
be made of the areas with which questioning and answering are
especially concerned.
 For what does reason purport to do?
‘Establish what is true, eliminate what is false and suspend
judgement in doubtful cases.’
 And is that all one has to learn?
‘Yes.’
Well, is it enough if you don’t want to be conned in the use of
money, just to be told to accept real coins and reject counterfeit
ones?
 ‘No, it is not enough.’
What else is necessary?
‘Obviously the art of testing and distinguishing genuine coins
from fake ones.’
 And so too in the case of reason, in addition to what we
named, we also have to learn how to test and distinguish what is
true, false and unclear.
‘Necessarily.’
 What else does reason prescribe?
‘To accept the consequence of what has been admitted to be
correct.’
 And is this all you need to know?
‘No, you also need to learn the rules of consequence, and how a
conclusion sometimes follows from one premise, sometimes from
several premises in combination.’
 Then surely this too must be acquired by the man intent on
acquitting himself intelligently in logical matters – both when he
oers his own proofs and demonstrations and when he is following
the demonstrations of others, so that he isn’t fooled when they
produce sophisms as if the proofs were really sound.  And so
there has developed among us study and training in conclusive
arguments and logical gures – both of which have proven
indispensable.
 Now, there are cases where we have rightly granted the
premises, and yet they yield a conclusion which, though false,
nevertheless logically follows from the premises.  What am I to
do then? Accept the false conclusion?  How can I? Say I erred in
granting the premises? That has been ruled out too. Say it did not
follow from the premises? But this is not an option either.
 So what should I do in such cases? Well, just as it is not
enough to have borrowed money to establish that you’re still in
debt, you still must stand by the loan and not have repaid it already;
so in this case it is not enough to have granted the premises to
establish that we must admit the conclusion: we must still be
committed to the same premises.  Now, if the premises remain
what they were when we granted them, then we are under every
obligation to stand by what was granted and accept what follows.
 But if they do not remain as they were, we don’t have to accept
it,∗  because the conclusion no longer holds for us. Nor is it
tting that we accept it, since we have retracted our admission of
the premises.14
 That’s why we need to study premises of this kind, and in
particular ones that involve changes and alterations such that, in the
very process of questioning, answering, drawing conclusions and so
forth, they undergo changes and cause the untutored to become
confused when confronted with the conclusions. Why?  To
avoid acting in these matters in a confused, awkward or
inappropriate way.
 It is no dierent with hypotheses and hypothetical
arguments. It is sometimes necessary to posit an hypothesis as a
basis for the succeeding argument.  Then should we grant every
hypothesis that is proposed, or not? And if not every one, then
which?  And once we have admitted an hypothesis, should we
abide by the admission come what may, or should we sometimes
repudiate it? Should we accept what is consistent with it and reject
what is in conict?
‘Yes.’
 But someone says, ‘I will make you accept the hypothesis of
something possible and lead you on to something impossible.’15 Will
the wise man refuse to engage with such a person, and avoid all
dialogue and examination?  But of all people he is supposed to
be most adept in argument, expert in question and answer, and
proof against sophisms and deceit.  Or will he engage with him
but without caring whether he argues in a confused or careless
manner? In that case how then will he be the sort of man we
imagine him to be?  But in default of such training and
preparation how can he follow the progress of an argument?  If
someone can show us that he can, then all our logical exercises were
a waste of time; they were otiose all along, not entailed by our
preconception of a philosopher.
 Why are we still lazy, indierent and dull? Why do we look
for excuses to avoid training and exercising our powers of reason?
 ‘Look, if I err in such matters I haven’t killed my father, have
I?’ No, fool – for there was no father there for you to kill! What did
you do instead? You made the only mistake you had the opportunity
to make.
 You know, I once said the same thing to Musonius when he
reproached me for not discovering the omission in a certain
syllogism. I said, ‘It’s not like I burned down the Capitol.’ And he
said, ‘Idiot, the omission here is the Capitol.’  I mean, are these
the only crimes, killing your father and burning down the Capitol?
But to use one’s impressions recklessly, carelessly and at random, to
fail to analyse an argument as either valid proof or fallacy, and, in a
word, to fail to see in the act of question and answer what agrees
with your position and what conicts – is nothing wrong in all of
that?
I 8 That talents are treacherous for the uneducated
 It is possible to vary the forms of rhetorical proofs and
enthymemes in as many ways as it is possible to vary terms that are
equivalent to each other.  Take, for example, the following
argument: ‘If you borrowed money from me and did not repay it,
you owe me the money.’ This is equivalent to: ‘It is not the case that
you borrowed and did not repay and do not owe me the money.’ 
And no one is better equipped to argue skilfully than the
philosopher. Because if the enthymeme is an incomplete syllogism,
someone trained in the complete syllogism will a fortiori be no less
procient handling the incomplete syllogism.
 ‘So why aren’t we training ourselves and each other in this
sort of argumentation?’
 Because at the moment, even though we aren’t being trained
in these topics – aren’t, in fact, being distracted at all, so far as I
have any say in the matter, from the business of improving our
character – we still aren’t making progress toward the goal of virtue.
 So what can we expect if we take on this additional project,
especially since it won’t just distract us from weightier matters, but
will be no small cause of pride and egotism?  Proof and
persuasion are great talents, when they are trained, and especially
when they’re complemented by a certain amount of verbal elegance.
 In general every talent when it gets into the hands of the
morally weak comes with the risk of making them conceited and full
of themselves.  I mean, what’s to stop a promising young student
from becoming a slave to – rather than a master of – these topics?
 Won’t he brush these cautions aside and parade his learning in
front of us, proud, elated and deaf to anyone who would forcefully
remind him of the studies he has given up, and the areas where he
stills falls short?
 ‘But wasn’t Plato a philosopher?’16
Yes, and Hippocrates was a physician.
‘And look at how well Hippocrates expresses himself.’
 Yes, but is it in his capacity as a physician that Hippocrates
expresses himself so well? Don’t confuse qualities that are found in
the same writer only incidentally.  If Plato had been strong and
handsome, should I also try to become strong and handsome, as if
this were essential to philosophy, since there was one particular
philosopher who combined philosophy with good looks?  Can’t
you tell the dierence between what makes people philosophers and
the qualities that are only found in them by chance?
I mean, if I were a philosopher, would you be required to become
lame as well?17
So am I slighting these talents?  Not at all – any more than I
would disparage the gift of sight.  But ask me what the real
good in man’s case is, and I can only say that it is the right kind of
moral character.
I 9 What are the consequences for us of being
related to God?
 If what philosophers say about the kinship of God and man is
true, then the only logical step is to do as Socrates did, never
replying to the question of where he was from with, ‘I am Athenian,’
or ‘I am from Corinth,’ but always, ‘I am a citizen of the world.’ 
After all, why say, ‘I am Athenian’? Why not just identify yourself
with the exact spot your sorry body was dropped at birth? 
Clearly, you prefer the higher designation because it not only
includes that insignicant spot, it also includes your parents and all
your ancestors before you; and it’s on these grounds that you
characterize yourself as Athenian or Corinthian.
 But anyone who knows how the whole universe is
administered knows that the rst, all-inclusive state is the
government composed of God and man. He appreciates it as the
source of the seeds of being, descending upon his father, his father’s
father – to every creature born and bred on earth, in fact, but to
rational beings in particular,  since they alone are entitled by
nature to govern alongside God, by virtue of being connected with
him through reason.  So why not call ourselves citizens of the
world and children of God? And why should we fear any human
contingency?  If being related to the emperor or any of the other
great ones at Rome is enough to live without fear, in privilege and
security, shouldn’t having God as our creator, father and defender
protect us even more from trouble and anxiety?
 ‘But how am I supposed to eat, if I am destitute?’ someone
says.
Well, what about slaves, what about runaways – what do they
depend on when they ee their masters? On their lands, their
servants and their silver plate? Hardly; they rely on themselves, and
still manage to survive.  So is our philosopher citizen-of-theworld going to rest his condence in others wherever he lives or
travels, rather than depend on himself? Is he going to be even lower
and more servile than irrational wild beasts, all of whom are selfsucient, provided with food and a mode of survival adapted to
and in harmony with their nature?
 Personally I think that, as I am older than you, I shouldn’t
have to sit here trying my best to keep you from thinking small, or
having mean and humble thoughts about you.  On the contrary,
if there are young men among you who know of their kinship with
the gods, and know that we have these chains fastened upon us –
the body, possessions and whatever is required for our biological
support and sustenance – I should be discouraging them from the
wish to shed all these things as so many chains and return to their
kind.
 That’s the eort that should absorb your teacher and mentor,
if he really were one. And you for your part would come to him
saying, ‘Epictetus, we can no longer stand being tied to this hateful
body, giving it food and drink, resting it and cleaning it, and having
to associate with all manner of uncongenial people for its sake. 
Such things are indierent, are they not, and as nothing to us; and
death no evil thing? Aren’t we akin to God, having come from him?
 Let us go home, then, to be free, nally, from the shackles that
restrain us and weigh us down.  Here we nd robbers and
thieves, and law-courts, and so-called despots who imagine that
they wield some power over us precisely because of our body and its
possessions. Allow us to show them that they have power over
precisely no one.’
 Then it would be my turn to say, ‘Friends, wait upon God.
Whenever he gives the sign and releases you from service, then you
are free to return. But for now agree to remain in the place where
you’ve been stationed.  Your time here is short enough, and
easy to endure for people of your convictions. No despot, thief or
court of law can intimidate people who set little store by the body
and its appurtenances. So stay, don’t depart without good reason.’
 That is the kind of advice that should pass between a teacher
and an idealistic youth.  But what’s the reality? You – and your
teacher – are no better than carcasses. No sooner have you eaten
your ll today than you sit and start worrying about where
tomorrow’s food will come from.  Look, if you get it, then you
will have it; if not, you will depart this life: the door is open. Why
complain? What place is there left for tears? What occasion for
attery? Why should one man envy another? Why should he admire
those who have many possessions, or those who are strong in power
and quick to anger?  What can they do to us, or for us, after all?
The things they have power to do are of no interest to us; and as for
the things we do care about, these they are powerless to aect. No
one with convictions of this kind can be made to act against their
will.
 So how did Socrates stand in this regard? Exactly how one
would expect of someone who perceived keenly his kinship with the
gods.  ‘If you were to say to me now, “We will release you on
these conditions, that you no longer engage in these dialogues that
you have been engaging in up to now, and won’t give any more
trouble to anyone young or old,”  I will answer that it is absurd
to suppose that, if a general of yours stationed me at a post, I would
have to maintain and defend it, choosing to die a thousand times
rather than quit, but if God has assigned us a post with a set of
duties, we might decide to abandon that.’
 There you have a man who was a genuine kinsman of the
gods.  But we, on the other hand, identify with our stomachs,
guts and genitals. Because we are still vulnerable to fear and desire,
we atter and creep before anyone with the power to hurt us where
any of those things are concerned.
 A man once asked me to write to Rome for him because he
had met with what most people consider misfortune. He had once
been rich and famous but later lost everything, and was living here
in Nicopolis. So I wrote a letter on his behalf in a deferential tone.
 When he had read the letter he handed it back to me, saying,
‘I wanted your help, not your pity; nothing really bad has happened
to me.’
 Similarly, Musonius used to test me by saying, ‘Your master
is going to aict you with some hardship or other.’  And when
I would answer, ‘Such is life,’ he would say, ‘Should I still intercede
with him when I can get the same things from you?’  For in fact
it is silly and pointless to try to get from another person what one
can get for oneself.  Since I can get greatness of soul and
nobility from myself, why should I look to get a farm, or money, or
some oce, from you? I will not be so insensible of what I already
own.
 For men who are meek and cowardly, though, there is no
option but to write letters for them as if they were already dead.
‘Please grant us the body of so-and-so together with his meagre
ration of blood.’  For, really, such a person amounts to no more
than a carcass and a little blood. If he were anything more, he
would realize that no one is ever unhappy because of someone else.
I 10 To those who have applied themselves to advancement
at Rome
 If we philosophers had applied ourselves to our job as seriously
as those old men in Rome pursue their interests, we, too, might be
getting somewhere.  I have a friend even older than I who is now
in charge of the grain supply in Rome. When he passed through here
on his return from exile, what things he said in disparagement of his
former life, swearing when he returned that from then on he would
devote himself exclusively to a life of peace and tranquillity. ‘How
much time have I got left, after all?’
 And I said to him, ‘I don’t believe you. As soon as you get a
whi of Rome you will forget everything you’ve said’ – and I added
that if the least access to court became available to him, he would
rush in, singing hymns of praise to the Almighty.  ‘Listen,
Epictetus,’ he said, ‘if you nd me even putting a foot inside the
court, feel free to think as little of me as you like.’  So what did
he do? Before he even reached the limits of the capital he received
letters from Caesar, immediately forgot all he’d said, and doesn’t
seem to have given it a thought since.  I’d like to be there with
him now to repeat to him the words he said when passing through
here, and add, ‘How much more shrewd a prophet I proved than
you!’
 Well, am I implying that man is an animal unt for action?
Not at all. So why aren’t we more active?  I mean, look at me.
When day begins, I remind myself of the author we are supposed to
be reading; but then I think to myself, ‘Who cares how this or that
student reads the author; rst let me get my sleep!’
 And yet how can their business compare in importance to
ours? If you could see them at Rome, you would nd that they do
nothing all day but vote on a resolution, then huddle together a
while to deliberate about grain, land or some other means to make a
living.  Is it the same thing to receive a petition that reads,
‘Please allow me to export a bit of grain,’ and ‘Please learn from
Chrysippus how the universe is governed, and what place the
rational creature has in it; nd out, too, who you are, and what
constitutes your good and your evil’?  Is one to be compared
with the other? Do they deserve the same degree of application?
 Is it equally wrong to neglect this one as that?
Well, am I and the other teachers the only ones who are lazy and
indierent?  You young people are even worse. Old men like us,
you know, when we see children at play, like nothing better than to
join them in their game. Likewise, I would be a lot more excited
about joining you in serious study if I were once to see you brighteyed and enthusiastic.
I 11 Concerning family aection
 During a visit from a magistrate Epictetus, in the course of
conversing, asked the man whether he had a wife and children. 
He replied that he did. Epictetus then asked, ‘And how do you like
it?’
‘I’m miserable,’ he said.
So Epictetus asked, ‘How so?  Men don’t marry and have
children in order to be miserable, but to be happy.’
 ‘I’m so anxious about my poor children,’ the man said, ‘that
the other day, when my little daughter was sick and appeared in
danger of her life, I could not bear even to remain with her. I had to
leave her side and go o until word was brought me that her
condition had improved.’
‘Well,’ said Epictetus, ‘do you think you acted correctly in this
case?’
 ‘I acted naturally,’ he answered.
‘If you can convince me that you acted naturally, I am ready on
my side to show that anything done in accord with nature is done
correctly.’
 ‘It’s what nearly all we fathers go through.’
‘I don’t dispute that reactions like yours occur,’ Epictetus said.
‘The point at issue between us is whether they ought to.  For by
your reasoning we must allow that tumours happen for the good of
the body, because they happen, and that doing wrong is in accord
with nature, because all, or at least most of us, do wrong.  So
show me how, exactly, you acted in accordance with nature.’
‘I don’t think I can,’ the man said. ‘Why don’t you show me
instead how it is not in accordance with nature, and shouldn’t
happen?’
So Epictetus said,  ‘Well, if we were in any uncertainty about
white and black things, what criterion would we adduce to choose
between them?’
‘Sight,’ the man said.
‘And what about things hot and cold, or hard and soft -what
would decide in those cases?’
‘Touch.’
 ‘Now, since we have a dierence of opinion about what is in
agreement with nature and what is right and wrong, what standard
should we apply here, do you think?’
‘I don’t know,’ the man said.
 ‘Well, ignorance in discriminating between colours, smells or
avours probably does no great harm. But not to know about right
and wrong, about what is natural in man’s case and what is not – is
that a minor shortcoming, do you think?’
‘No, a very great one, I admit.’
 ‘Consider now – is everything that people judge to be good
and appropriate rightly judged so? Can Jews, Syrians, Egyptians and
Romans all be right in the opinions they have about food, for
example?’18
‘How could they?’
 ‘Instead, if the opinions of the Egyptians are right, I suppose
that the others are wrong. Or if the Jews are right, then the others
can’t be.’
‘No, they cannot.’
 ‘And where there is ignorance, there is also want of learning
and instruction in essentials.’
The man agreed.
 ‘Once you’ve realized this, you will occupy your mind and
devote all your attention toward nding that standard that
discriminates between what is natural and what is not; and then
apply it to particular cases as they arise.
 ‘For the present, I can only oer the following by way of
assistance toward solving our problem.  Tell me, then, do you
think family aection is good and agrees with nature’s norms?’
‘I do.’
‘Can family aection be good and natural,∗ while what agrees
with reason is not good?’
‘Of course not.’
 ‘So whatever is rational will not be in conict with family
aection.’
‘I suppose not.’
‘Because, if they were, one would be in agreement with nature
while the other would have to conict.’
‘Correct.’
 ‘So if there’s anything out there that’s both aectionate and
rational, this we can safely say is also both right and good.’
‘Agreed.’
 ‘Now, to leave your child’s side when she is sick, and go
away, is not a rational act, and I don’t suppose that even you will
argue otherwise. But we still have to consider whether it is
consistent with family aection.’
‘Then let’s do so.’
 ‘Was it right for you, being aectionately disposed toward
your child, to go o and leave her? Let’s take her mother instead.
Doesn’t she feel aection for her daughter?’
 ‘Of course she does.’
‘Then should she, too, have left her?’
‘No.’
‘And the nurse – does she have aectionate feelings toward the
girl?’
‘She does.’
‘So should she, also, have left her?’
‘Certainly not.’
‘And her personal slave and teacher, doesn’t he have feelings for
her?’
‘Yes.’
 ‘I suppose that means that he, too, should have gone o and
left her – the result being that, owing to this very great aection on
the part of parents as well as guardians, the girl would have been
completely forsaken by those who love and protect her, to die in the
company of people who had no part in bringing her up, and
therefore no special feelings for her.’
‘I can hardly suppose so.’
 ‘In fact, it is unfair and illogical to say that people whose
aection is the equal of yours should not be permitted to do what
you claim was justied in your case owing to this very great
aection you profess.’
‘True enough.’
 ‘I mean, if you were sick, would you want your family, your
wife, children and the rest, to be so caring as to walk away from you
and leave you to yourself?’
‘No.’
 ‘And would you want to be so loved by them that, because of
their love, you would always suer sickness in isolation? Isn’t that
more like the aection you pray your enemies would show you, that
they should go away and leave you be? And if so, the inescapable
conclusion is that what you did was no act of aection at all.
 ‘Well, it had to have been something that aected you so
much that you walked out on your child. It might be related to the
impulse that made a man at Rome cover his head while his favourite
horse was running, and who later required sponges to be revived
when his horse unexpectedly won.  The precise explanation for
such behaviour might be out of place here. For now, assuming that
philosophy contains at least a grain of truth, it’s enough to be
convinced that you will not nd it by looking for any cause outside
yourself. The same thing is always the reason for our doing or not
doing something, for saying or not saying something, for being
elated or depressed, for going after something or avoiding it. 
It’s the same reason that you’re here now listening to me, and I’m
saying the things that I’m now saying –  our opinion that all
these things are right.’
‘Of course.’
‘If we saw things dierently we would act dierently, in line with
our dierent idea of what is right and wrong.  This, then, was
the cause of Achilles’ lamentations – not the fact that Patroclus died,
since other people don’t carry on so when a friend or companion
dies – but the fact that he chose to lament.  The same cause lies
behind your desertion of your daughter – you thought it was a good
idea at the time. Conversely, if you stay with her, it would be for the
same reason. Now you are about to return to Rome; that is your
decision – but if it changes, you won’t go.  In other words, it
isn’t death, pain, exile or anything else you care to mention that
accounts for the way we act, only our opinion about death, pain and
the rest.
 ‘Well, have I convinced you of this, or not?’
‘You have,’ the man said.
‘As the cause is, so is the result.  Whenever we do something
wrong, then, from now on we will not blame anything except the
opinion on which it’s based; and we will try to root out wrong
opinions with more determination than we remove tumours or
infections from the body.  By the same token, we will
acknowledge opinion as the source of our good behaviour too. 
But wife, child, slave or neighbour – in the future we won’t name
any of them as authors of the evil in our lives, in the knowledge
that, unless we judge things in a particular light, we won’t act in the
corresponding manner. And we, not externals, are the masters of our
judgements.’
‘Agreed.’
 ‘So, starting today, we won’t trouble to assess or analyse
land, slaves, horses or dogs as to their quality or condition -only our
opinions.’
‘Well, I hope so,’ the man said.
 ‘You see, you are going to have to become a student again –
that universal gure of fun – if you really mean to subject your
opinions to honest examination. And you know as well as I do that
this assignment can’t be completed overnight.’
I 12 On satisfaction
 On the subject of the gods, there are those who deny the
existence of divinity outright. Others say that God exists, but is idle
and indierent and does not pay attention to anything.  A third
group says that God exists and is attentive, but only to the workings
of the heavens, never aairs on earth. A fourth group says that he
does attend to earthly aairs, including the welfare of humanity, but
only in a general way, without worrying about individuals.  And
then there is a fth group, Odysseus and Socrates among them, who
say that ‘I cannot make a move without God’s notice.’19
 Before doing anything else we need to examine these views
separately to decide which are true and false.  Because if the
gods do not exist, what sense can be made of the command to
‘follow the gods’?20 And how can it be a sensible goal if they exist,
but do not have any cares?  Even supposing that they exist and
care, if that care does not extend to people, and, in point of fact, to
me personally, it is still no worthwhile goal.
 The intelligent person, after due consideration of the question,
will decide to submit his will to the ruler of the universe, as good
citizens submit to the laws of the state.
 Education should be approached with this goal in mind: ‘How
can I personally follow the gods always, and how can I adapt to
God’s government, and so be free?’  Freedom, you see, is having
events go in accordance with our will, never contrary to it.
 Well – is freedom the same as madness? Of course not.
Madness and freedom are poles apart.  ‘But I want my wishes
realized, never mind the reason behind them.’  Now, that’s
madness, that’s insanity. Freedom is something good and valuable;
to arbitrarily wish for things to happen that arbitrarily seem to you
best∗ is not good, it’s disgraceful.
How do we approach the practice of writing?  Do I want to
write the name ‘Dion’ whatever way I please? No, I learn to want to
write it the way it is supposed to be written. The case is the same
with music,  the same with every art and science; it would not
be worth the trouble to learn them, otherwise, if they
accommodated everyone’s wishes.  And freedom, the greatest
possession of all, is the last thing you would expect to be dierent,
where wishes are given carte blanche. Getting an education means
learning to bring our will in line with the way things happen –
which is to say, as the ruler of the universe arranged.  He
arranged for there to be summer and winter, abundance and lack,
virtue and vice – all such opposites meant for the harmony of the
whole; and he gave us each a body and bodily parts, material
belongings, family and friends.21
 It is with this arrangement in mind that we should approach
instruction, not to alter the facts – since this is neither allowed, nor
is it better that it should be – but in order to learn the nature of
what concerns us, and keep our will in line with events.  Can
we avoid people? How is that possible? And if we associate with
them, can we change them? Who gives us that power?  What is
the alternative – what means can be found for dealing with them?
One that ensures that we remain true to our nature, however other
people see t to behave.  That’s not what you do, though. No,
you gripe and protest against circumstance. If you’re alone, you call
it desolation, if you’re in company you describe them all as
swindlers and backstabbers; you curse your own parents, your
children, your siblings and neighbours.  When you are by
yourself you should call it peace and liberty, and consider yourself
the gods’ equal. When you’re with a large group you shouldn’t say
you’re in a mob or crowd, but a guest at a feast or festival – and in
that spirit learn to enjoy it.
What is the downside for those who refuse to accept it? To be just
as they are.  Is someone unhappy being alone? Leave him to his
isolation. Is someone unhappy with his parents? Let him be a bad
son, and grumble. Is someone unhappy with his children? Let him
be a bad father.  ‘Throw him in jail.’ What jail? The one he is in
already, since he is there against his will; and if he is there against
his will then he is imprisoned. Conversely, Socrates was not in
prison because he chose to be there.22
 ‘But my leg is crippled.’
Slave, are you going to be at odds with the world because of one
lame leg? Shouldn’t you rather make the world a gift of it, and
gladly return it to the one who gave it to you originally?  Are
you going to make Zeus your enemy, and set your face against the
Fates, with whom Zeus spun the thread of your destiny at the
moment you were born, laying out his plans for you?
 You ought to realize, you take up very little space in the
world as a whole – your body, that is; in reason, however, you yield
to no one, not even to the gods, because reason is not measured in
size but sense.  So why not care for that side of you, where you
and the gods are equals?
 ‘It’s my bad luck to have awful parents.’
Well, you couldn’t very well choose them beforehand, saying, ‘Let
this man have intercourse with this woman, at this particular, so
that I can be conceived.’  Your parents had to come rst, then
you had to be born the way you are, of parents the way they are.
 Does that mean you have to be miserable? Let’s suppose you
didn’t understand what you had the power of vision for; it would be
your bad luck if you decided to close your eyes just at the moment a
beautiful painting passed before you. You are even unluckier for
being oblivious to the fact that you have the power of patience to
deal with your diculties.  You forget the virtues of character
you have in reserve, just when problems that they can control
present themselves, and you could use their help.
 You should thank the gods for making you strong enough to
survive what you cannot control, and only responsible for what you
can.  The gods have released you from accountability for your
parents, your siblings, your body, your possessions – for death and
for life itself.  They made you responsible only for what is in
your power – the proper use of impressions.  So why take on
the burden of matters which you cannot answer for? You are only
making unnecessary problems for yourself.
I 13 On the treatment of slaves
 When someone asked how it was possible to eat in a manner
pleasing to the gods, Epictetus said, ‘If is done justly and equitably,
in moderation, with restraint and self-control – isn’t that pleasing to
the gods?
 ‘When you ask for hot water and the slave ignores you; or if
he hears you but brings in water that is barely lukewarm; or if he is
not even to be found in the house – to refrain from anger and not
explode in that situation, won’t that nd favour with the gods?’
 ‘But how are we to bear with such slaves?’
‘My friend, it’s a matter of bearing with your own brother, who
has Zeus as his ancestor and is a son born of the same seed as
yourself, with the same high lineage.
 ‘If you have been placed in a position above others, are you
automatically going to behave like a despot? Remember who you
are and whom you govern – that they are kinsmen, brothers by
nature, fellow descendants of Zeus.’
 ‘But I have a bill of sale for them, while they have none for
me.’
‘Don’t you see that, instead of the laws of the gods, you only have
regard for the earth, the pit and the contemptible laws of the dead?’
I 14 That God supervises everyone
 Someone asked Epictetus how a person could be convinced that
everything he did was supervised by God.
‘Don’t you believe,’ he answered, ‘that all things are united as
one?’
‘I do,’ the other said.
 ‘Well, don’t you think that there is interaction between things
on earth and the things in heaven?’
‘Yes.’
 ‘How else, after all, could things take place with such
regularity, as if God were issuing orders? When he tells plants to
bloom, they bloom, when he tells them to bear fruit, they bear fruit,
when he tells them to ripen, they ripen. Similarly, when he tells
them to drop their fruit, shed their leaves, draw in and lie dormant
for the winter, all that they do too.  How else explain that the
waxing and the waning of the moon, and the coming and going of
the sun, coincide with such obvious changes and uctuations here
on earth?
 ‘Well, if plants∗ and our bodies are so intimately linked to the
world and its rhythms, won’t the same be true of our minds – only
more so?  And if our minds are so intimately connected with God
as to be divine sparks of his being, is he not going to perceive their
every movement, since the parts in motion participate in his nature?
 Now you, for your part, are capable of reecting in detail on
God and his government, while also tending to human aairs. You
can process in your intellect and senses a wealth of thoughts and
impressions simultaneously. There are impressions that you assent
to, others that you reject; sometimes you suspend judgement
altogether.  Your mind can store so many of these impressions
and from a wide range of sources too. Under their inuence, the
mind proceeds to form ideas that correspond with particular
impressions. That’s how we form memories, and how the many
varieties of art and science are created.
 ‘And now God – are we going to deny him the ability to
oversee everything that happens, even when we know that he is
present everywhere and enjoys a kind of communion with the
world?
 ‘The sun is capable of illuminating a large part of the
universe, just leaving unlit the small shadow that the earth casts.23
Well, here is God, who created the sun (which is minuscule in
relation to the whole universe), and who still causes the sun to turn
– wouldn’t you say he is in a good position to see everything that
goes on?’
 ‘And yet,’ someone objects, ‘I cannot understand all these
things at one and the same time.’
‘Is anyone saying that your capacities are the equal of God’s? 
Nevertheless, he has provided each of us with an individual
guardian deity, which stays by our side and is in charge of looking
after us – a guardian who never sleeps and is impossible to distract.
 Is there any guardian to whose care he could have committed
us that is better or more vigilant? Whenever you close your doors
and turn out your lights, remember, never say to yourself that you
are alone;  you’re not. God is inside, and so is your private
deity; and neither of them requires light to watch you by.
 ‘This is the deity who deserves your pledge of allegiance, as
soldiers swear before Caesar. If they want to be paid, they must
swear to put the emperor’s safety rst. You, however, who have
been chosen to receive an abundance of blessings – and for free –
why won’t you swear a similar oath, and, if you have done so
already, why not rearm the commitment?
 ‘What is that oath? You swear that under no circumstances
will you disobey, press charges, or nd fault with God and his gifts.
You won’t shrink from life’s essential tasks or trials.  Can
anyone seriously compare the soldier’s oath with ours? They swear
to honour no one more than Caesar; we swear to honour no one
more than ourselves.’
I 15 What philosophy professes
 Someone asked Epictetus’ advice on how to get his brother to
stop being on bad terms with him. Epictetus said,  ‘Philosophy
does not claim to secure for us anything outside our control.
Otherwise it would be taking on∗ matters that do not concern it. For
as wood is the material of the carpenter, and marble that of the
sculptor, so the subject matter of the art of life is the life of the self.’
 ‘Well, what about my brother’s life?’
‘That, in turn, belongs to his own art of living. With respect to
yours, it is one of the externals – no dierent from land, health or
reputation; and philosophy makes no promises concerning those. 
In every situation I will keep the soul’s governing principle in
agreement with nature.’
‘Whose governing principle?’
‘Only the one inside me.’
 ‘How, then, do I stop my brother from being angry with me?’
‘Bring him to me and I will speak with him; but about his anger I
have nothing to say to you.’
 The man consulting with Epictetus then asked, ‘What I want
to know is this, then: how can I stay true to nature even if my
brother won’t reconcile with me?’
 ‘Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes
or gs need time to ripen. If you say that you want a g now, I will
tell you to be patient. First, you must allow the tree to ower, then
put forth fruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe.  So if
the fruit of a g tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an
hour, how do you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so
quickly and easily? Don’t expect it, even if I were personally to tell
you it was possible.’
I 16 On providence
 Do not be surprised if other animals have their biological
necessities provided for them – not just food and drink, but a place
to sleep – and have no need of shoes, bedding or clothes, while
humans, on the other hand, need all these things.  It was not
expedient in the case of creatures born to serve others, not
themselves, to have made them in any way decient in these
respects.  After all, think what it would be like if we had to
worry about nding clothes and shoes, or food and drink, for our
sheep and asses, in addition to having to provide these essentials for
ourselves.
 Just as soldiers report to their commander at the ready,
clothed, armed, and shod – and it would be too much to expect the
commander to have to equip them out of his own time and pocket –
so nature has created the animals that are born for service ready for
our use and in no need of further attention.  The result is that a
single small child, armed with no more than a stick, can control an
entire ock of sheep.
 As it is, though, we neglect to give thanks for not having to
bestow on beasts the same care as we do on ourselves, then
complain to God concerning our own condition.  Yet, I swear, if
we had an ounce of gratitude or respect, the least aspect of creation
would be enough to get us to admit the existence of providence. 
And I’m not talking about great things, now; take the mere fact that
milk is produced from grass, and that cheese comes from milk, and
wool can grow out of skin. Who is it that has created or conceived
these things? ‘No one,’ people say. What ignorance and gall!
 Let’s leave the chief features of nature aside, and just consider
its secondary eects.  Is there anything of less utility than a
beard? But nature has found a most becoming use even for that,
enabling us to discriminate between the man and woman. 
Nature identies itself even at a distance: ‘I am a man: come and
deal with me on these terms. Nothing else is needed; just take note
of nature’s signs.’
 In the case of woman, in addition to mingling a softer note
in her voice, nature has removed the hair from her chin. But you
say, ‘The creature could have done very well without this
distinguishing mark; we could announce of ourselves that we are
man or woman.’  But you miss the point: look how proud,
handsome and becoming the sign is, much more attractive than the
cock’s comb, prouder even than the lion’s mane.  That is why
we should safeguard the signs that God gave us and by virtue of
which the genders were intended to be distinguished.
 Are these the only works of providence relevant in our case?
Hardly. In fact, there are no words adequate to praise them or do
them justice. If we had sense, there is nothing better we could do
with our time than praise God and proclaim his good works,
whether in public or private.  We should praise him even while
we’re busy digging, ploughing or eating. ‘God is great – he has given
us these instruments to work the earth.  God is great – he has
given us hands, a mouth and a stomach, the ability to grow
unconsciously, and to breathe while we’re asleep.’  This is what
we ought to sing on every occasion – more especially the greatest
and holiest hymn, celebrating the ability he bestowed on us to
understand his works, and use them systematically.
 Well, since most of you are blind, I suppose there has to be
someone who lls this role, and will praise God on others’ behalf.
 And what is a lame old man like myself good for, anyway,
except singing God’s praises? If I were a nightingale or a swan, I
would sing the song either of them was born to sing. But I am a
rational being, so my song must take the form of a hymn.  That
is my job, which I will keep to as long as I am permitted; and I
invite any and all of you to join me.
I 17 Concerning the necessity of logic
 Since reason is what analyses and coordinates everything, it
should not go itself unanalysed. Then what will it be analysed by?
 Obviously by itself or something dierent. Now, this something
dierent must either be reason or something superior to reason –
which is impossible, since there is nothing superior to reason. 
But if it is analysed by reason, what, in turn, will analyse that
reason? Itself? If that’s the case, however, the rst occurrence of
reason could have done the same; whereas if another form of reason
is required, the process will continue for ever.
 ‘Yes, but in any case it is more important that we tend to our
passions, and our opinions, and the like.’
So it is lectures about these subjects that you’d rather hear? Fine.
 But if you say to me, ‘I don’t know whether your arguments are
sound or not,’ or if I use a word in an ambiguous sense and you ask
me to ‘Please distinguish’ – well, I’m not going to be in a mood to
oblige you, I’m more liable to say, ‘It’s more important that we tend
to our passions and our opinions, and the like.’
 Which, I suppose, is why Stoics put logic at the head of our
curriculum – for the same reason that, before a quantity of grain can
be measured, we must settle on a standard of measurement.  If
we don’t begin by establishing standards of weight and volume, how
are we going to measure or weigh anything?  And similarly in
the present case – if we haven’t fully grasped and rened the
instrument by which we analyse and understand other things, how
can we hope to understand them with any precision?
 ‘But a measuring bowl is a mere thing of wood, and doesn’t
put forth fruit.’
It measures grain, however.
 ‘Matters of logic are unproductive as well.’
Well, we will see about that. But even if you are right, because it
analyses and distinguishes them logic functions, in a way, as the
weight and measure for abstract matters, and that is reason enough,
the experts say, to study it.  Who says so? Besides Chrysippus,
Zeno and Cleanthes, I mean?24  How about Antisthenes? It was
he who wrote, ‘The beginning of education is the examination of
terms.’ And as we know from Xenophon, Socrates routinely began
his talks by analysing terms, in order to forestall any uncertainty as
to their meaning.
 Is this the ultimate achievement, then – getting to where we
can understand and interpret Chrysippus? Nobody is saying that.
 Well, what is, then? Understanding the will of nature. Yes, but
can you understand it alone and unaided? Evidently you could still
use help; because if it is true that we always err unwillingly,25 and if
you were already in possession of the truth, it would be reected in
your awless behaviour.
 But I don’t understand the will of nature. Who will explain it
to me? I’m told Chrysippus can.  So o I go to nd out what
this interpreter of nature has to say. But then there’s a passage I
have trouble with, so I cast about for someone to explain the
explanation. ‘Here,’ I say, ‘have a look and tell me what this means’
– as if the thing were in Latin.∗  What right has the
commentator to feel superior? Even Chrysippus has no right to be
proud if he only explains the will of nature and does not follow it;
how much less entitled to pride is his interpreter!
 It’s not Chrysippus per se we need, but only insofar as he
helps us understand nature. We don’t need the prophet for his own
sake, but through him we think we can divine the future and better
understand the signs that the gods send.  We don’t need the
victim’s entrails for their own sake, only for the sake of the signs
they convey. And we don’t worship the crow or the raven – we
worship God, who communicates by means of them.  Now
imagine me before a priest or prophet, to whom I say, ‘Please
examine this victim’s entrails; what are they telling me?’  After
carefully spreading them out, he announces, ‘It’s written here that
you have a will incapable of being coerced or compelled.  Start
with assent: can anyone prevent you from agreeing with what is
true?’
‘No.’
‘Or force you into believing what is false?’
‘No.’
 ‘Plainly, then, in this area your will cannot be hindered,
forced or obstructed.  Let’s look at desire and impulse: you see
it’s just the same. One impulse can only be overruled by another.’
 ‘What about if someone threatens me with death, though;
surely he compels me then?’
‘It isn’t what you’re threatened with – it’s the fact that you prefer
to do anything rather than die.  It’s your set of values that
compelled you: will acting on will.  If God had made it possible
for the fragment of his own being that he gave us to be hindered or
coerced by anyone – himself included – then he wouldn’t be God,
and wouldn’t be looking after us the way a god ought to. 
“That,” the priest says, “is what I nd inscribed in the sacrice. This
is God’s signal to you: if you want, you are free; if you want, you
will blame no one, you will accuse no one – if you want, everything
will happen according to plan, yours as well as God’s.”
 ‘That’s the kind of prophecy I go to this priest for, and to the
philosopher; out of reverence, not for him, but for his powers of
interpretation.’
I 18 Don’t be angry with wrongdoers
 Philosophers say that people are all guided by a single standard.
When they assent to a thing, it is because they feel it must be true,
when they dissent, it is because they feel something isn’t true, and
when they suspend judgement, it is because they feel that the thing
is unclear.  Similarly, they say that in the case of impulse people
feel that its object must be to their advantage, and that it is
impossible to consider any one thing advantageous and desire
something dierent, or consider one thing right and have an
impulse to do something else.
If all this is true, then what grounds do we have for being angry
with anyone?  We use labels like ‘thief’ and ‘robber’ in
connection with them, but what do these words mean? They merely
signify that people are confused about what is good and what is
bad. So should we be angry with them, or should we pity them
instead?  Show them where they go wrong and you will nd that
they’ll reform. But unless they see it, they are stuck with nothing
better than their usual opinion as their practical guide.
 ‘Well, shouldn’t we do away with thieves and degenerates?’
Try putting the question this way:  ‘Shouldn’t we rid ourselves
of people deceived about what’s most important, people who are
blind – not in their faculty of vision, their ability to distinguish
white from black – but in the moral capacity to distinguish good
from bad?’  Put it that way, and you’ll realize how inhumane
your position is. It is as if you were to say, ‘Shouldn’t this blind
man, and this deaf man, be executed?’  Because if loss of the
greatest asset involves the greatest harm, and someone is deprived
of their moral bearings, which is the most important capacity∗ they
have – well, why add anger to their loss?  If you must be aected
by other people’s misfortunes, show them pity instead of contempt.
Drop this readiness to hate and take oence.  Who are you to
use those common curses, like ‘These damned fools,’ etc.?  Let
them be. Since when are you so intelligent as to go around
correcting other people’s mistakes? † We get angry because we put
too high a premium on things that they can steal. Don’t attach such
value to your clothes, and you won’t get angry with the thief who
takes them. Don’t make your wife’s external beauty her chief
attraction, and you won’t be angry with the adulterer.  Realize
that the thief and the adulterer cannot touch what’s yours, only
what is common property everywhere and not under your control. If
you make light of those things and ignore them, who is left to be
angry with? As long as you honour material things, direct your
anger at yourself rather than the thief or adulterer.
 Look at it this way. You have beautiful clothes and your
neighbour does not. You have a window and want to give them an
airing. The neighbour does not know what man’s good consists in,
but imagines it means having beautiful clothes – the opinion you
happen to share.  It’s a foregone conclusion that he’s going to
try and steal them. I mean, when starving people see you gobbling
down food all by yourself, you know one of them will make a grab
at it. So don’t provoke them – don’t air your clothes at the window!
 Something similar happened to me the other day. I keep an
iron lamp by my household shrine. Hearing a noise from my
window, I ran down and found the lamp had been lifted. I reasoned
that the thief who took it must have felt an impulse he couldn’t
resist. So I said to myself, ‘Tomorrow you’ll get a cheaper, less
attractive one made of clay.’  A man only loses what he has. ‘I
lost clothes.’ Yes, because you had clothes. ‘I have a pain in the
head.’ Well, at least you don’t have a pain in the horns, right? Loss
and sorrow are only possible with respect to things we own.
 ‘But the tyrant will chain -’ What will he chain? Your leg. ‘He
will chop o -’ What? Your head. What he will never chain or chop
o is your integrity. That’s the reason behind the ancient advice to
‘know yourself’.
 We should discipline ourselves in small things, and from
there progress to things of greater value.  If you have a
headache, practise not cursing. Don’t curse every time you have an
earache. And I’m not saying that you can’t complain, only don’t
complain with your whole being. If your servant is slow to bring
you a bandage, don’t roll around and yell, ‘Everybody hates me!’
Who wouldn’t hate such a person?  Walk upright and free,
trusting in the strength of your moral convictions, not the strength
of your body, like an athlete. You weren’t meant to be invincible by
brute force, like a pack animal.  You are invincible if nothing
outside the will can disconcert you.
So I run through every scenario and consider them as an athlete
might: ‘He lasted the rst round; how will he do in the second? 
What if it’s hot? What if it’s the Olympics?’ Similarly: ‘If you entice
him with money, he will turn up his nose. But what if it’s a pretty
girl – whom he meets in the dark? What if you tempt him with
fame? Or test him with censure – or applause? Or death?’ All these
he can handle.  But what if it’s really sweltering – that is, what
if he’s drunk? Or delirious? Or dreaming?26 If he can come through
safely under all these conditions – well, that’s the invincible ‘athlete’
so far as I am concerned.
I 19 How we should act towards the powerful
 A person who enjoys some advantage, or just believes they do,
will invariably grow to be arrogant, especially if they are
uneducated.  The tyrant, for example, will say to you, ‘My power
is supreme.’
‘Will you do something for me then? I want uncurbed desire. Do
you even have it to give? I want my aversion error-free. Do you
have that? How about a faculty of impulse that is faultless?  No,
you have no connection to that. Look, you entrust yourself to the
pilot’s expertise when on board ship, and to the superior skill of the
driver when you are in a carriage.  It’s no dierent with other
skills. So what does your advantage amount to?’
‘Everybody gives me their attention and respect.’
‘Right, and I pay attention to my blackboard, wiping it, and
washing it; and for my oil ask I’ll even drive a nail in the wall.
Does that make these things better than me? No – it just means that
they are useful to me somehow. I look after my horse too,  I
wash its feet and brush its coat. The fact is, everyone looks after
themselves; if they curry favour with you it’s as if they’re currying
their horse. Who is there who respects you as a human being? 
Who wants to be like you, to emulate you the way people emulated
Socrates?’
‘But I can cut o your head.’
‘Good point; I had forgotten that I should look out for you as I
would look out for some virus or infection, and erect an altar to you
on the model of the Altar of Fever at Rome.27
 ‘What frightens most people and keeps them subdued? It can’t
be the tyrant and his bodyguards; what nature has made free can
only be disturbed or hampered by itself.  A person’s own
thoughts unnerve them. If a tyrant threatens to chain our leg,
whoever holds his leg in high regard will beg for mercy, whereas
the person who cares more for his character will answerback, “Go
ahead and chain it, if that’s what you want.”’
‘And you don’t care?’
‘I don’t care.’
‘Just wait, I’ll show you who’s in charge!’
 ‘How do you propose to do that? Zeus himself has given me
my freedom; he was not going to allow any son of his to be
enslaved. You are master of my corpse, come help yourself to that.’
 ‘What about when you petition me for a favour, isn’t that
proof of your regard?’
‘No, it’s me looking after myself. If you press the point, I will
concede that in the process I give you the same attention I give my
dishes.
 ‘Look, this is not selshness, it’s the nature of the beast;
everything we do is done for our own ends. The sun moves across
the sky for its own ends.28 Even Zeus acts for his own aims.  But
when Zeus wants to be “Rain-Bringer”, or “Grain-Giver”, or “Father
of Gods and Men”, it’s obvious that he can only gain his goals and
earn his epithets by doing some benet for the world at large. 
In the same way he made the rational animal, man, incapable of
attaining any of his private ends without at the same time providing
for the community.
 ‘The upshot is that it is not anti-social to be constantly acting
in one own’s self-interest.  We do not expect someone, after all,
to be indierent regarding himself and his welfare. It’s the basis of
our principle of appropriation,29 the instinct that drives everyone’s
behaviour.  Consequently when people are mistaken in the
views they hold about things outside the will – thinking that they
are good or evil – they naturally are going to grovel before tyrants.
 And if only it ended there! But they grovel before the tyrant’s
lackies too. Tell me, how do underlings suddenly become sages
when the emperor elevates them to the post of bathroom attendant?
Why are we suddenly saying “Felicio’s30 advice to me was very
astute.”  I hope he gets kicked out of the toilet, so I can see you
change your mind again and declare publicly that he’s a fool.
 ‘Epaphroditus once owned a slave, a shoemaker, whom he
sold because he was no good. As chance would have it, he was
bought by one of the imperial household and became shoemaker to
Caesar. You should have seen Epaphroditus atter him then! 
“And how is my friend Felicio today?”  Whenever one of us
asked, “Where is the master?” he would be told, “He is in
conference with Felicio.”  Hadn’t he sold him o because he
was useless?  How did he become so knowledgeable all of a
sudden? Well, that’s what comes of valuing anything not under
control of the will.  Someone is raised to the oce of tribune
and accepts congratulations on every hand. One person kisses his
eyes, another his cheek, his slaves even kiss his hands. When he gets
home, he nds lamps being lit in his honour.  He mounts the
Capitol, where he oers a sacrice of thanks. Now who, I ask you,
has ever oered sacrice for right desires, or for impulses in
agreement with nature? We only thank the gods, it seems, for what
we popularly suppose are the good things in life.
 ‘A man spoke with me today about accepting a priesthood of
Augustus.31 I told him not to touch it. “You will lay out a lot of
money for little in return.”’
 ‘But the clerk will add my name to public contracts.’
‘Are you planning to be there every time a contract is signed, so
you can announce to the assembled, “That’s my name he’s writing
down there”?  Even if you can attend these signing ceremonies
now, what will you do when you die?’
‘But my name will survive me.’
‘Carve it in stone and it will survive you just as well. Outside
Nicopolis, though, no one is going to remember you.’
 ‘But I get to wear a crown of gold.’
‘If you have your heart set on wearing crowns, why not make one
out of roses – you will look even more elegant in that.’
I 20 Concerning reason, and how it studies itself
 Every craft or faculty has a eld with which it is primarily
concerned.  When the faculty happens to be like what it studies,
it naturally comes to study itself. When it is dierent, however, then
it cannot.  To give an example: shoemaking works on leather, but
the craft itself is quite distinct from leather; therefore, it does not
study itself.  The art of grammar has to do with written speech,
but is it written speech? No. Therefore, it cannot study itself.
 Now, for what purpose did nature arm us with reason? To
make the correct use of impressions. And what is reason if not a
collection of individual impressions? Hence, it naturally comes to
turn its analysis on itself.  And what does the virtue of wisdom
profess to investigate? Things good, bad and indierent. And what
is wisdom itself? Good. And ignorance? Bad. It is natural for wisdom
too, then, to investigate itself, as well as its opposite.
 Therefore, the rst and most important duty of the
philosopher is to test impressions, choosing between them and only
deploying those that have passed the test.  You know how, with
money – an area where we believe our interest to be much at stake
– we have developed the art of assaying, and considerable ingenuity
has gone into developing a way to test if coins are counterfeit,
involving our senses of sight, smell, hearing and touch.  The
assayer will let the denarius drop and listen intently to its ring; and
he is not satised to listen just once: after repeated listenings he
practically acquires a musician’s subtle ear.  It is a measure of
the eort we are prepared to expend to guard against deception
when accuracy is at a premium.
 When it comes to our poor mind, however, we can’t be
bothered; we are satised accepting any and all impressions,
because here the loss we suer is not obvious.  If you want to
know just how little concerned you are about things good and bad,
and how serious about things indierent, compare your attitude to
going blind with your attitude about being mentally in the dark.
You will realize, I think, how inappropriate your values really are.
 ‘But this calls for a lot of preparation, and hard study.’
So what? Do you think the greatest art can be acquired easily, and
overnight?  It’s true that the principal doctrine of the
philosophers is briey stated; you have only to read Zeno to see my
meaning.  How long does it take to say, ‘The goal is to follow
the gods,’ and ‘The essence of the good is the proper use of
impressions’?  But, just because it is so brief, the formula
prompts other questions: ‘What is God, and what is an impression?
How does individual nature compare with the nature of the whole?’
Now the inquiry is beginning to drag out.
 Here we have Epicurus saying that goodness is none other
than the esh. But then there are lectures to sit through about man’s
dominant principle – that is to say, about what his substance and
essence are – and the explanation begins to grow long again. It’s not
likely that the good of a snail lies in its shell, so is it likely that
Epicurus is correct in identifying man’s good with his body?
 Take yourself, Epicurus. Even you have a faculty that is
greater than the esh – the faculty which, having examined and
thought through the evidence, concluded that esh was the
principal thing.  And why are you so fond of burning the
midnight oil, working hard to produce so many books on our
behalf? Obviously, it must matter to you that we be put in
possession of the truth. But who are we, and, more to the point, who
are we to you?
Well, now the explanation of Epicurus’ views is growing lengthy
too…
I 21 To people who want to be admired
 When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn’t have
to look outside themselves for approval.
 ‘My friend, what is it you want?’
‘I am satised if my desires and aversions agree with nature, if I
exercise impulse and refusal as I was born to do, and if I practise
purpose, design and assent the same way.’
‘So why are you acting so stuck up?’
 ‘I want everyone I meet to admire me, to follow me around
shouting, “What a great philosopher!” ’
 And who exactly are these people that you want to be
admired by? Aren’t they the same people you are in the habit of
calling crazy? And is this your life ambition, then – to win the
approval of lunatics?
I 22 On preconceptions
 Everyone has preconceptions. And one preconception does not
contradict another. I mean, who of us does not assume that what is
good is benecial and choice, in all cases to be desired and pursued?
Who of us does not assume that justice is fair and appropriate? So
where does conict come in?  In the application of
preconceptions to particular cases.  One person, for instance, will
say, ‘Well done, there’s a brave man,’ while another says, ‘He isn’t
brave, he’s just deranged.’
This is how conict originates,  and it is the source of
dierence among Jews, Syrians, Egyptians and Romans. They don’t
dispute that what is holy should be preferred above everything else
and in every case pursued; but they argue, for example, over
whether it is holy or unholy to eat pork.  This is also the basis of
the conict between Agamemnon and Achilles. Call them up before
us.
‘What do you say, Agamemnon? Shouldn’t we do what is right
and proper?’
‘Naturally.’
 ‘What about you, Achilles? Wouldn’t you, of all people, say
that we ought to do what is appropriate?’
‘Of course.’
‘All right, then, apply your preconceptions.’
 It is just here that conict starts. Because one says, ‘I shouldn’t
have to return Chryseis to her father,’ and the other says, ‘Indeed
you’d better.’ It’s obvious that one of them is misapplying his
preconception of what is appropriate.  Then Agamemnon says,
‘Fine, if I have to give Chryseis back, then I should get one of the
other men’s prizes in return.’ Achilles says, ‘It’s not mine you intend
to take, I hope.’ ‘Yours, that’s right.’ ‘Why should I be penalized?’
‘Because it’s not right that I be the only one to go without.’ And this
is how conicts originate.
 What does it mean to be getting an education? It means
learning to apply natural preconceptions to particular cases as
nature prescribes, and distinguishing what is in our power from
what is not.  The operations of the will are in our power; not in
our power are the body, the body’s parts, property, parents, siblings,
children, country or friends.
 Where should we put the good, then – to which of the two
classes of things are we going to assign it? To the class of things in
our power.  It follows that neither health nor tness are good,
nor are our children, parents or country.
‘That view is not going to win you many friends or converts.’
 Well, let’s transfer the designation ‘good’ to health and other
externals and see what happens. Suppose someone meets with
misfortune and loses these ‘goods’; can they still be happy?
‘Impossible.’ You might ask, too, how they will remain on good
terms with their neighbours, since we naturally incline to selfinterest.  And if it is in my interest to own land, it is in my
interest to rob them of it. If it is in my interest to own a coat, it is in
my interest to pinch one from the baths. There you have the genesis
of wars, factions and seditions.
 And how will I be able to stay right with God? Because if I’m
harmed and meet with misfortune, I begin to doubt whether he is
looking after me. And if he won’t help me, why should I give him
my regard? I want nothing to do with a god who allows me to be in
my present state. So I begin to hate him,  and wonder if the
temples and statues we dedicate to him are not intended to placate a
malignant force, like Fever. Honorary titles like ‘Saviour’, ‘Rainbringer’ and ‘Fruit-bringer’ are no longer applicable to him – and all
this comes of identifying ‘the good’ with externals.
 What should we do? That’s the topic of inquiry for the
person who is truly out to philosophize and think deep. Now, if I am
in the dark as to what is good and bad, I’m crazy.  But if I
locate ‘the good’ in the realm of the will I risk being ridiculed. Some
grey old man rattling his gold rings and shaking his head at me will
come along and say, ‘Listen, my boy, philosophy’s all right up to a
point, but don’t get carried away. This question is ridiculous. 
Philosophers can teach you logic, but you know better than they do
the right way to behave.’  ‘Well, if I know what to do, as you
say, don’t make an objection if what I choose to do is philosophize.’
I’m not going to try to engage this fatuous old fool in logic. But if I
ignore him altogether, he’ll explode in indignation.  So I have
no choice but to say to him, ‘Humour me as you would someone in
love. I can’t help myself, you see, I’m mad.’
I 23 Against Epicurus
 Even Epicurus realizes that we are social creatures by nature,
but once he has identied our good with the shell,32 he cannot say
anything inconsistent with that.  For he further insists -rightly –
that we must not respect or approve anything that does not share in
the nature of what is good.
 So how is it that we are suspicious – we who supposedly have
no natural aection for our children?33 Why is it, Epicurus, that you
dissuade the wise man from bringing up children? Are you afraid
that he may become emotionally involved and unhappy?  And is
that because you have been anxious on behalf of your house-slave
Mouse?34
Well, what’s it to Epicurus, anyway, if his little Mouse comes
crying to him?∗
 No, he realizes that, once a child is born, it is no longer in our
power not to love or care for it.  Which is why he says that a
man of sense will not take part in politics either∗; he knows the
kinds of personal connections that politics involves. So what’s to
keep us from living as if we were as unsocial as ies?
 But as if he didn’t know this, he has the gall to suggest that
we should abandon our children. Even a sheep does not desert its
own ospring, or a wolf; should a human desert his?  Would you
have us be as foolish as sheep or as savage as wolves – neither of
which abandons its young?  Come on, whoever remembers your
advice when they see their little child fallen and crying on the
ground?
 Personally, I imagine that your own mother and father, even
had they predicted that you were going to say such things, would
not have exposed35 you.
I 24 How we should struggle with circumstance
 The true man is revealed in dicult times. So when trouble
comes, think of yourself as a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has
paired with a tough young buck.  For what purpose? To turn you
into Olympic-class material. But this is going to take some sweat to
accomplish. From my perspective, no one’s diculties ever gave
him a better test than yours, if you are prepared to make use of
them the way a wrestler makes use of an opponent in peak
condition.
 Now we are sending you to Rome as a spy. And we don’t want
one who is easily frightened, or one who will turn back at the rst
sound of noise, or glimpse of shadow, announcing hysterically that
the enemy is practically at the gates.  If you tell us on your
return, ‘Conditions are terrible in Rome, everywhere death, exile,
poverty, informants – everything a shambles. Fly, the enemy is upon
us!’  – we will respond by telling you in future to keep your
forecasts to yourself. Our only mistake was in sending a spy like you
in the rst place.
 Diogenes36 went scouting before you did and came back with
a very dierent report. Death, he said, was not evil because it was
not dishonourable. Reputation was the empty noise of fools.  And
he said other things that helped remove the element of fear from
pain and poverty. In his manner of life he preferred the minimum of
clothing to a purple gown, and the bare ground to a bed, however
soft.  And as proof of such claims, he produced his assurance, his
serenity, his freedom -as well as his tough, radiant physique.
 ‘There is no enemy near by,’ he said. ‘All is peace and
tranquillity.’
‘Explain, Diogenes.’
‘Look for yourself: am I wounded, disabled or in ight from any
enemy force?’
 That’s the kind of spy we honour. You bring us back a report
full of a lot of random noise. Go o and make a better search, this
time without the trepidation.
 ‘What should I do then?’
What do you do when you leave a ship? Do you walk o with the
rudder and oars? No; you leave with your own gear, your oil-ask
and wallet. So just remember what belongs to you, and you won’t
lay claim to what doesn’t.
 The emperor says to you, ‘Remove your broad hem.’
‘Very well, I’ll wear the narrow hem.’
‘Remove that too.’
‘All right, I’ll wear the ordinary toga now.’37
‘Take your toga o.’
‘Fine, I’ll go naked.’
 ‘Now your very composure provokes me.’
‘Take my whole body, then.’
Is there any reason to fear someone to whom I stand ready to
surrender my miserable corpse?
 But so-and-so will not leave his estate to me. Well? I forgot
that none of it was mine. How then do we call it mine? As we call
the bed in an inn mine. If the innkeeper dies and leaves you his bed,
ne; but if he leaves it to someone else, then he will have it, and you
will nd a replacement.  And if you don’t, then you will have to
sleep on the ground. Only rest easy there and snore away, because,
remember, tragedies take place among the rich – among kings, and
potentates. No poor man swells a tragedy except as a member of the
chorus.  Kings start o well enough: ‘Deck the palace halls.’ But
then around the third or fourth act, we get, ‘O Cithaeron, why did
you receive me?’38  Fool, where are your crowns, your diadem?
Even your guards can’t help you now.
 So when you stand before one of those tyrants, just bear in
mind that you are in the presence of a tragic gure – and not the
actor, either, but Oedipus himself.
 ‘But he’s so lucky to be able to walk around with an
entourage.’
Well, I too mingle with the masses and so am attended by an
entourage.  The chief thing to remember is that the door is
open.39 Don’t be a greater coward than children, who are ready to
announce, ‘I won’t play any more.’ Say, ‘I won’t play any more,’
when you grow weary of the game, and be done with it. But if you
stay, don’t carp.
I 25 More on the same theme
 If what we’ve been saying is true and we aren’t being ridiculous,
or merely pretending to believe that what is good or bad for us lies
in the will and that we are indierent to everything else – then why
do we continue to experience fear and anxiety?  No one has
power over our principles, and what other peopledo control wedon’t
care about. So what is your problem, still?
 ‘My problem is that I want specic instructions on how to act
in line with these principles.’
What other orders do you need than those Zeus has given you
already? He has given you what is your own unrestricted and
unrestrained; what is not yours he has made restricted and
restrained.  What commandment, then, did you arrive with when
he sent you here? ‘Protect what belongs to you at all costs; don’t
desire what belongs to another.’ Trustworthiness is your own,
decency and a sense of shame;∗ no one can take them from you or
prevent you from using these qualities except yourself – which you
do the moment you begin to care about what isn’t yours,
surrendering what is yours in the process.
 With such directions and commands from Zeus, what
additional ones do you hope to get from me? Am I greater or more
to be trusted?  Keep his commandments and you won’t need
others. And as proof that he has delivered them to you, bring your
preconceptions to bear. Bring the arguments of philosophers. Bring
what you’ve often heard, and often said yourself; what you’ve read,
and what you’ve practised.
 Just how long should we apply these precepts that we have
from God, before breaking up the game?  Just so long as the
game remains a pleasure. At the Saturnalia a king of the revels is
chosen by chance, because this is the convention.40 Then our ‘king’
hands out orders: ‘Drink up! You there, mix the wine! You, sir, give
us a song! You, join the party; while you there – get lost!’ And we
play along with him, so that the game will not be spoiled on our
account.  But if the ‘king’ says, ‘Imagine that you are unhappy,’
and I demur, who is going to force me?  If, on the other hand,
the programme calls for the re-enactment of Achilles’ quarrel with
Agamemnon, and the actor in the role of king says to me, ‘Go and
get Briseis away from Achilles,’  I’ll go. When he says, ‘Return,’
I’ll return.
The way we handle hypothetical arguments can also serve as a
model for our behaviour.41 ‘Let’s assume that it is night.’
‘Fine.’
‘Then is it day?’
‘No, because I’ve accepted the hypothesis that it is night.’
 ‘Let’s assume, in the manner of a game or play, that you
pretend to believe that it is night.’
‘OK.’
‘Now, believe that it really is night.’
 ‘That does not follow from the hypothesis.’
The same rules apply in life: ‘Let’s assume you’ve come upon hard
times.’
‘Granted.’
‘Then you are unfortunate.’
‘Yes.’
‘And suering.’
‘Yes.’
‘Now believe that what has happened to you is bad.’
‘That does not follow from the hypothesis. Besides, there is
another who won’t let me.’42
 How long should we submit to the rules of the game? As
long as it serves my turn, and I nd the part congenial.  Some
dour, inexible types will say, ‘I can’t eat at this man’s table if it
means listening to his war stories again: “I told you, friend, how I
scrambled up the hill; now we came under renewed
bombardment…”’  But another person in the same situation
might say, ‘The meal is what matters; let him rattle on to his heart’s
content.’  It is for you to arrange your priorities; but whatever
you decide to do, don’t do it resentfully, as if you were being
imposed on. And don’t believe your situation is genuinely bad – no
one can make you do that.  Is there smoke in the house? If it’s
not suocating, I will stay indoors; if it proves too much, I’ll leave.
Always remember – the door is open.
 ‘Do not remain in Nicopolis,’ they say to me; so I don’t
remain there.
‘Don’t stay in Athens either.’
So I quit Athens.
‘Not Rome either.’
So I abandon Rome.
 ‘Live on Gyara.’43
But for me living on Gyara amounts to more smoke in my house
than I can stand. So I depart to the one place no one can stop me
from going, where everyone is made welcome.  And when I
remove my last piece of clothing – my skin – then no one can lay a
hold of me any longer.  Which is why Demetrius was
emboldened to say to Nero, ‘You threaten me with death, but nature
threatens you.’
 If I cherish my body, I make a slave of myself, if I cherish my
property, I make a slave of myself;  because I’ve disclosed the
means to make me captive. When a snake pulls back its head, right
away I think, ‘Hit it just there, on the part that it’s protecting.’ In the
same way you may be sure that whatever you are seen to protect,
that will become your enemy’s focus of attack.  Keep this in
mind, then there will be no one you will need to fear or atter.
 ‘But I want to sit in the senators’ gallery.’
Look, the crowd is of your own creation, you’re treading on your
own toes.
 ‘But how else am I to get a clear view of the stage?’
If you don’t want to be crowded, don’t attend the theatre. What’s
the diculty? Or wait until the show is over, then seat and sun
yourself at leisure in the senators’ seats.  In general, remember
that it is we who torment, we who make diculties for ourselves –
that is, our opinions do. What, for instance, does it mean to be
insulted?  Stand by a rock and insult it, and what have you
accomplished? If someone responds to insult like a rock, what has
the abuser gained with his invective? If, however, he has his
victim’s weakness to exploit, then his eorts are worth his while.
 ‘Strip him.’ What do you mean, ‘him’? Take his garment, you
mean, and remove that. ‘I have insulted you.’ ‘A lot of good may it
do you.’  That is what Socrates practised, maintaining always
the same even temper. But it seems that we would practise and
study anything rather than how to remain free and unenslaved.
 ‘Philosophers speak in paradoxes.’
And what of the other arts – are they dierent? What is more
paradoxical than cutting into a person’s eye to restore their vision?
If someone suggested this procedure to a person ignorant of
medicine, they would laugh in the practitioner’s face.  Little
wonder, then, if many of the truths of philosophy also impress the
masses as paradoxical.
I 26 What is the law of life?
 When a person was reading the hypothetical arguments,
Epictetus said, ‘This is a law concerning hypotheses, that we must
accept what follows by way of conclusion. Even more cogent is the
law of life that obliges us to act in accordance with nature.  If we
mean to obey it in every area, on every occasion, clearly we must
never allow what nature prescribes to escape us, and allow into our
lives what runs contrary to nature.
 ‘So philosophers start us out with logic, since it’s easier,
reserving more problematic subjects for later. In the study of logic,
there is nothing to distract us; whereas in practical matters our
attention is constantly pulled in other directions.  Whoever
insists on jumping right into practical matters risks making a fool of
himself, since it’s not easy tackling harder subjects rst.  And this
is the right defence to use with parents upset with their children
because they study philosophy: “Have it your way, father: my
judgement is poor and I don’t know what I really should be doing.
But if this can neither be learned nor taught, then don’t blame me
for it. If it can, however, then either teach it to me yourself, or let
me learn it from someone who professes to know;  since I hope
you don’t suppose that if I’m doing the wrong thing it’s by choice.
So what else could explain my error but ignorance?  And
wouldn’t you rather I be cured of that? When did anger, however,
ever teach someone to play music or pilot a ship? Do you imagine
that your anger is going to help teach me the far more complex
business of life?”
 ‘But that line of argument assumes that such actually is your
motive for studying philosophy;  anyone learning logic and
attending philosophy lectures to make a show of erudition at a
dinner party is satised just to win the respect of some senator
seated beside him.  For that is where the important matters are,
and treasures there are accounted tries here. Consequently, it is
hard to be master of one’s impressions in matters of ethics, where
things that muddle the judgement are so many.
 ‘I know of one man who cried, clinging to Epaphroditus’
knees, saying how miserable he was now that he was down to his
last million.  And what did Epaphroditus do – laugh at him as
you are laughing now? No, he was appalled, and said, “Dear man,
how did you keep silent up till now? How have you endured it?” ’
 When Epictetus corrected the person reading the
hypothetical arguments and the person who had set him the reading
began ridiculing him, Epictetus said, ‘You are laughing at yourself.
You did not prepare the student properly or make sure he could
understand these arguments. And still you use him as a reader. 
Well then,’ he said, ‘if a mind doesn’t have the aptitude to follow
and judge a conjunctive argument, why do we assume it’s capable of
awarding praise, assigning blame or forming a judgement about
things good and bad? If that person thinks ill of a person, will the
other person care? Or if he admires someone, will that someone
jump for joy – when in such minor matters of logic he can’t make an
inference or draw a correct conclusion?
 ‘This, then, is the beginning of philosophy – an awareness of
one’s own mental tness. Consciousness of its weakness will keep
you from tackling dicult subjects.  As it is, though, some
people strain at a pamphlet and still want to devour an entire
treatise. Naturally they can’t digest it, and get heartily sick of the
whole business.  They need to rst gure out what their
capacity is. In the realm of logic it is easy to refute someone
ignorant of the subject. But in the aairs of life, no one oers
himself to be examined, and whoever presumes to examine us we
resent.  And yet Socrates used to say that the unexamined life
was not worth living.’
I 27 In how many ways impressions arise, and what aids
we should provide against them.
 Impressions come to us in four ways: things are and appear to
be; or they are not, and do not appear to be; or they are, but do not
appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to be.  The duty of
an educated man in all these cases is to judge correctly. And
whatever disturbs our judgement, for that we need to nd a
solution. If the sophisms of the Pyrrhonists and the Academics44 are
what trouble us, we must look for the antidote.  If it is the
plausibility of things, causing some things to seem good that are
not, let us seek a remedy there. If it is habit that troubles us, we
must try to nd a corrective for that.
 What aid can we nd to combat habit? The opposed habit. 
You hear people commonly saying things like, ‘He died, the poor
man’; ‘His father perished, his mother too’; ‘He was cut down in his
prime, and in a foreign land.’  Lend your ear to dierent
descriptions, distance yourself from statements such as these, check
one habit with its opposite. Against sophistry one should have the
practice and exercise of rational argument. Against specious
impressions one should have clear preconceptions polished and
ready to hand.
 When death appears an evil, we should have ready the fact
that it is a duty to avoid evil things, whereas death is necessary and
cannot be avoided.  I mean, where am I going to go to get away
from it? Maybe I am not Sarpedon, the son of Zeus, so that I can say
in the same grand manner, ‘I will go, and either win the prize for
valour myself, or give another the opportunity to gain it.’45 The
former may be beyond us, but at least the latter is within our reach.
 And where can I go to escape death in any case? Tell me the
country, give me the name of the people who are safe from death,
where I can get asylum; provide me with the magic charm. No, I
cannot escape death,  but at least I can escape the fear of it – or
do I have to die moaning and groaning too?
Passions stem from frustrated desire;  so if I am able to shape
conditions to suit my wishes, I will do so, but if not, I am ready to
maul anyone who stands in my way.  People by nature cannot
endure being deprived of the good or meeting up with evil. 
And if, in the end, I can’t alter circumstances, or tear to pieces the
person who prevents me, then I sit and bawl, abusing everyone I can
think of, including Zeus and the other gods. For if they do not look
after me, why should I care about them?  ‘But you will be
blasphemous.’ Well, what punishment could they devise in that case
that would make my situation worse? Remember that, as a rule,
unless piety and self-interest can be reconciled, piety cannot be
preserved. Don’t you nd that convincing?
 Let the Pyrrhonist and Academic philosophers step forward
to face us.
‘For my part, I have no leisure for these controversies, nor can I
simply side with convention.’46
 Now, if I had a dispute about property I would have called in
a lawyer to help with my case. What will meet my needs in this
instance?  The process of perception – whether it involves the
entire body or only a part – this I may not be able to explain,
because either alternative seems problematic to me. But that you
and I are not the same person – of that I’m quite certain.  I
mean, when I want to swallow something, I never carry it to your
mouth, but my own. And when I want bread, I don’t grab a broom, I
head straight for the bread like an arrow to its target.∗  And
you Sceptics, who dismiss the evidence of the senses – do you act
any dierently? Which one of you ever went to the mill when you
were in need of a bath?
 ‘Well, shouldn’t we be diligent defenders of convention,
then, and watchful for any attack on it?’  Certainly – provided
we have the leisure for controversies of this kind. The person who is
trembling, upset and inwardly broken in spirit needs to spend his
time dierently, though.
I 28 That we should not be angry with people; and
what people account great and small
 The cause of our assenting to the truth of something is that it
appears to be fact.  And it is impossible to assent to anything that
does not appear to be fact. Why? It is the mind’s nature: it will
assent to the truth, reject what is false and suspend judgement in
doubtful cases.
 Here, I will prove it to you: feel, if you can, that it is night
now. ‘Impossible.’ Don’t feel that it is now day. ‘Impossible.’ Feel, or
don’t feel, that the number of stars is even. ‘Impossible.’  So
when someone assents to a false proposition, be sure that they did
not want to give their assent, since, as Plato says, ‘Every soul is
deprived of the truth against its will.’47  They simply mistook for
true something false.
Now, with respect to our actions, the case is analogous, only
instead of true and false we react to impressions of right and wrong,
good and bad, honest and dishonest.  And it is impossible to
think that an action will do us good and not choose to do it.
 What about Medea, though – she who says:
I know that the acts I intend are wrong
But anger is the master of my intentions.
That only amounts to saying that she thinks gratifying her anger
by exacting revenge on her husband is preferable to keeping her
children safe.48  ‘Yes, but she is in error.’ Well, demonstrate to
her clearly that she is in error and she will not act on her idea. As
long as you don’t lay it out for her, though, she has nothing besides
her own idea of right and wrong to guide her.  So don’t get angry
at the poor woman for being confused about what’s most important,
and accordingly mutating from human being to snake. Pity her
instead. We take pity on the blind and lame, why don’t we pity
people who are blind and lame in respect of what matters most?
 Whoever keeps in mind that our actions are all determined by
our impressions, which can either be right or wrong – now, if the
impression is correct, we are innocent, but if it is incorrect we pay
for it ourselves, since it is impossible that someone else should be
penalized for our error – whoever keeps this in mind will not be
angry or upset with anyone, won’t curse, blame, resent or malign
anyone either.
 ‘So in your view great tragedies are merely the result of this
– somebody’s “impression”?’
The result of that and that alone.  You take the Iliad: it’s
nothing but people’s impressions and how they dealt with them. An
impression made Paris rob Menelaus of his wife, and an impression
got Helen to run away with him.  Now, if an impression had
come to Menelaus that perhaps he was better o losing such a wife
– well, that would have meant the loss to us not just of the Iliad but
of the Odyssey as well.
 ‘So you’re saying that matters so great owe their origin to
something so trivial?’
But what do you mean by ‘matters so great’? Wars, factions, the
loss of many men, the razing of cities – tell me what’s so ‘great’
about all that?  What’s so great about slaughtering many sheep
or cattle, or burning a lot of storks’ or swallows’ nests? 
‘Can you really compare the two?’ Why not? In the one case
human bodies are lost, in the other case the dead happen to be farm
animals. People’s houses burn, so do storks’ nests.  What’s so
earth-shaking or awful in that? Show me how a house, considered
merely as shelter, is better than a stork’s nest.  ‘How can a stork
be compared with a human being?’ Where the body is concerned,
there is lots of similarity, only in man’s case his body inhabits
houses composed of bricks and timber, while storks’ nests are made
of sticks and mud.
 ‘So is there no distinction between a person and a stork?’
Of course there is, but not in regard to these externals. 
Reect and you’ll realize that man excels in other respects: in taking
cognisance of his own behaviour; in being sociable, trustworthy and
honourable; in learning from his own mistakes; in brains.  What
counts as good and bad for man can be found precisely in those
respects in which he diers from the beasts. If his special qualities
are kept safe behind stout walls, and he does not lose his honour,
trustworthiness or intelligence, then the man is saved. But lose or
take away any of these qualities and the man himself is lost.
 Everything signicant depends on this. Did Paris’ tragedy lie
in the Greeks’ attack on Troy, when his brothers began to be
slaughtered?  No; no one is undone by the actions of others.
That was the destruction of storks’ nests. His tragedy lay in the loss
of the man who was honest, trustworthy, decent and respectful of
the laws of hospitality.  Wherein did Achilles’ tragedy lie? The
death of Patroclus? Not at all. It was that he gave in to anger, that
he whined about losing a mere woman and lost sight of the fact that
he was there not for romance but for war.  Those are the
genuine human tragedies, the city’s siege and capture – when right
judgements are subverted; when thoughts are undermined.
 ‘Women are driven into captivity, children are enslaved, and
men are put to the sword. Is none of this bad?’
 What’s the basis for adding that description? Let me in on it
too.
‘Why don’t you explain instead how they are not evils?’
 Let’s turn to our standards, produce our preconceptions. I
mean, this is what abbergasts me. If there’s a question about
weight, we don’t formulate a judgement at random; if it’s a matter
of judging straight and crooked, we don’t make our decision based
on whim.  If the truth of the case makes any dierence to us at
all, then none of us operates in the dark.  Yet when it comes to
the rst and foremost cause of good and bad conduct; when it’s a
matter of doing well or ill, of failure or success – only then do we
proceed blindly and erratically, only then are we found to lack
anything like a scale or measure. A sense impression appears and
right away I react.  Am I better than Agamemnon and Achilles,
insofar as they do and suer such wrongs by following their
impressions, while the impression does not satisfy me?  Is there
any tragedy with a dierent source? What is the Atreus of Euripides?
An impression. The Oedipus of Sophocles? An impression. The
Phoenix? An impression. Hippolytus?49 An impression.  What
kind of person, then, pays no attention to the matter of impressions,
do you think? Well, what do we call people who accept every one
indiscriminately?
‘Madmen.’
And do we act any dierently?
I 29 On steadfastness
 The essence of good and evil consists in the condition of our
character.  And externals are the means by which our character
nds its particular good and evil.  It nds its good by not
attaching value to the means. Correct judgements about externals
make our character good, as perverse or distorted ones make it bad.
 God has xed this law, and says, ‘If you want something good,
get it from yourself.’ But you say, ‘No, I’ll get it from another.’ I say,
‘No – get it from yourself.’  If a tyrant threatens me at court, I
say, ‘What is he threatening?’ If he says, ‘I will put you in chains,’ I
say, ‘He is threatening my hands and feet.’  If he says, ‘I will
behead you,’ I say, ‘He is threatening my neck.’ If he says, ‘I will
throw you into prison,’ I say, ‘He is threatening my entire body’; if
he threatens exile, I say the same.  ‘Well, then, aren’t you
threatened, even a little?’ If I feel that these things are nothing to
me, then no.  But if I fear for any of them, then, yes, it is I who
am threatened.
Who is there left for me to fear, and over what has he control?
Not what is in my power, because no one controls that except
myself. As for what is not in my power, in that I take no interest.
 ‘So do you philosophers teach contempt for rulers?’
Not at all. You don’t nd any of us preaching deance of them
within their range of competence.  My body, my property, my
standing in society, my friends – they can have them all. And I
challenge anyone to say that I encourage others to lay claim to those
things.
 ‘Yes,’ the king says, ‘but I want control over your judgements
too.’ Who gave you that power? You cannot add the judgements of
others to your conquests.  ‘I will win by way of fear.’ You do
not seem to realize that the mind is subject only to itself. It alone
can control it,  which shows the force and justice of God’s edict:
the strong shall always prevail over the weak.  ‘Ten are stronger
than one.’ Yes, for what, though? For taking people captive, for
killing or dragging them o, for taking away their property. For
main force, yes, ten are better than one.  But one person with
right judgements is superior to ten without. Numbers here are
irrelevant. Put them in the balance, the person with correct ideas
will outweigh all the others.
 ‘To think of the indignities Socrates suered at the hands of
the Athenians!’ Not ‘Socrates,’ stupid, express yourself more
carefully: ‘To think that Socrates’ poor body should have been
seized and hauled o to prison by men stronger than it, that
somebody gave his poor body hemlock, that it grew progressively
colder until it was dead.’  What seems unjust, or outrageous, in
this, or worth blaming the gods for? Didn’t Socrates have resources
to compensate?  Where was the essence of the good for him –
and who is more to be heeded in that regard, him or you? ‘Anytus
and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot harm me,’50 he says, and:
‘If it pleases the gods, so be it.’
 Produce a person who can get the better of someone whose
judgements are superior. You can’t, though, try as you might. This is
God’s law and nature’s: ‘Let the best man win.’ But ‘best’ in his area
of expertise.  One body is stronger than another body, many
bodies are stronger than one; a thief has the advantage here over
one who is not a thief.  This is how I came to lose my lamp:51
the thief was better than I am in staying awake. But he acquired the
lamp at a price: he became a thief for its sake, for its sake, he lost
his ability to be trusted, for a lamp he became a brute. And he
imagined he came out ahead!
 Fine words, you may say – but now I have been seized by the
cloak and am being dragged downtown. Bystanders shout, ‘Hey,
philosopher, what good did your views do you after all? Look,
you’re being hauled o to prison and soon will be beheaded.’ 
Tell me, what Introduction to Philosophy could I have read that would
have saved me from being dragged away if a stronger man grabs me
by the cloak; or could have kept me out of prison if I am assaulted
by a gang of ten?  What philosophy has taught me, though, is to
be indierent to events beyond the will’s control.  Haven’t you
proted in this respect too? So don’t look for help from philosophy
except in areas where you have learned that help from it can be
found.  As I sit in prison I can say, ‘Whoever laughs at me is
deaf to the real meaning of words, can’t understand what they hear,
and doesn’t even care to know what it is philosophers say or do. Let
them be.’
 But the answer comes: ‘Come out of prison.’ If you have no
further need of me in prison, I’ll come out; if you need me, I’ll go
back in again.  ‘How long will you keep this up?’ For as long as
the mind chooses to be with the body. But when the mind no longer
consents, then you can take my body, and farewell to it.  Only,
we must not part with it rashly or irrationally, or on trivial pretext.
Because, again, God does not wish it. He needs us, he needs the
world that we help populate. If he sounds the signal for retreat,
though, as he did for Socrates, we must obey the signal as if it came
from our commander-in-chief.
 Well, should we try telling this to the ignorant mob? 
What would be the point? It’s enough if we are convinced of it
ourselves. When children come up to us clapping their hands and
shouting, ‘Today is good Saturnalia,’ do we say, ‘The Saturnalia is
not “good”?’ Of course not, we clap our hands right along with
them.  As for you, if you can’t change a person’s mind, realize
that he is no more than a child – and clap hands with him. And if
you can’t bring yourself to do that, then just keep quiet.
 It is essential that we remember this, so that, when troubles
arise, we will know that it’s time to exhibit what we’ve learned.
 A student fresh out of school who gets into diculty is like
someone practised in the solving of syllogisms; if anyone gives him
an easy one, he says, ‘Give me a knotty one instead, I want a bit of
practice.’ In the same way, athletes don’t like to be paired with
pushovers.  ‘He can’t lift me,’ one says, ‘this other guy is better
built.’ No, when the crisis comes, we groan and say, ‘I wanted to
keep on learning.’ Keep learning what? If you didn’t learn these
things in order to demonstrate them in practice, what did you learn
them for?
 I suppose there might be some who are sitting here losing
patience and thinking, ‘Why don’t I get to face the kind of challenge
he did? I am growing old in a corner, when I could be winning a
crown at Olympia! When will I be nominated for a similar trial?’
That is the attitude that all of you should adopt.  There are
gladiators at Rome who get frustrated if they are not called out and
matched with an opponent, all the while begging God and their own
supervisors to be allowed to do battle one-on-one. None of you here
shows anything like the same mettle.  Which is why I would
like to escape to Rome to see my favourite wrestler in action, how
he, at least, puts policy into practice.
 ‘These are not the circumstances that I want.’ Is it up to you
to choose them? You have been given that particular body, these
particular parents and brothers, this particular social position and
place to live. You come to me hoping that I can somehow change
these circumstances for you, not even conscious of the assets that
are already yours that make it possible to cope with any situation
you face.  ‘It is yours to choose the exercise, mine to manage it
well.’ Right, but instead you say, ‘Don’t set me that kind of
hypothetical argument, give me that one instead; don’t give me that
compound proposition, give me that other one.’  The time is
coming when actors of tragedy will identify with their masks, their
high-heeled boots, and their long robe. Wake up, those are props
representing your circumstances and situation.  Say something
so that we’ll know whether you are a tragic actor or the comic relief
– because of the costume you two have in common.  Does the
tragic actor disappear, if you take away his boots and mask and
bring him onstage a mere shadow of his former self – or is he there
still? If he has the right voice, he remains.
 So it is in life: take a governorship. ‘I take it and, when I take
it, I show how a real philosopher acts.’  Take o your senator’s
robe and put on beggar’s rags – and let’s have a look at you then.
‘Well, so what? I still have the gift of a ne voice to show o.’ 
What role do you appear in now? As a witness called by God. 
‘Step forward, you, and bear witness for me; you earned the right to
represent me as a witness. Is anything good or bad that is
independent of your will? Do I do any man harm? Have I put each
man’s advantage under the control of anyone except himself?’ What
witness do you bear God?  ‘I’m in diculty, lord, and pitiable:
no one cares about me, no one helps me; I’m the object of universal
scorn.’  Is that the witness you are going to bear, making a
mockery of God’s summons, when he honoured you and judged you
worthy to be his public spokesman?
 But what if someone in authority pronounces you godless
and atheistic?52 How are you aected? ‘I have been judged godless
and atheistic’  Nothing more? ‘Nothing.’ If he had passed
judgement on a conditional argument, and said, ‘The proposition
that “If it is day, it is light” I declare to be false, what has happened
to the conditional? Who is judged in this case? Who has been
condemned – the conditional, or the person who got it wrong?’
 Well, then, who is this man who is empowered to pass
judgement on you? Does he know anything about what is religious
or irreligious? Has he studied and learned about it? Where, and
from whom?  You know, a musician has no consideration for
anyone who mistakes the highest string on the lyre for the lowest;
and anyone who arms that, in a circle, lines that extend from the
centre to the circumference can be unequal is not going to win the
respect of mathematicians.  So – a true philosopher is under no
obligation to respect vulgar opinion as to what is religious or
irreligious, what is just or unjust. What dishonour he brings on
philosophers in general if he did! That’s not what you learned here.
 Wouldn’t you rather leave petty arguments about these
subjects to do-nothings who sit in a corner and receive their little
stipend, or get nothing and whine about it? Step forward and make
use of what you’ve learned.  It isn’t more logic chopping that is
needed – our Stoic texts are full of that. What we need now are
people to apply their learning and bear witness to their learning in
their actions.  Please, be the one to take on this character, I am
tired in my teaching of invoking examples from the past, I want to
be able to hold up an example from my own time.
 Consideration of these factors belongs to people who have
the leisure for it; because man is an animal made for abstract
thought.  But, for our honour’s sake, let’s not be seen studying
them as if we were slaves who have run away. We should sit
composed, without distraction, listening now to the tragic actor,
now to the musician – not act like escapees who are moved to praise
the performers while continually glancing nervously around, and
who come apart completely if their master’s name is dropped. 
It is beneath the dignity of philosophers to study nature in this
spirit. For what does ‘master’ mean? Man is not the master of
another man, only death and life are, pleasure and pain.
So bring Caesar and not these other things before me and I am
resolute.  But when he comes in thunder and lightning
brandishing these things, and I show fear in response, in eect I
have been brought face to face with my master, just like a runaway
slave.  Even while I have a reprieve from these factors, my
attention to the performance is no better than the slave’s. I wash,
drink, sing, but all in a spirit of gloom and foreboding.  If,
however, I liberate myself from my master – which is to say, from
the emotions that make my master frightening – what troubles can I
have? No man is my master any longer.
 Well, is it our duty to announce these truths to everyone?
No, instead we need to make allowances for people without the
benet of education, and say to ourselves, ‘He is telling me to do
this because he imagines it’s good for himself as well; so I can’t
blame him.’  Socrates himself forgave his jailer when he began
to drink the hemlock, and the man broke down in tears, saying, ‘It
shows great generosity of spirit for him to grieve for us.’  Does
he say to the jailer, ‘That’s why we wouldn’t let the women in!’ No,
he only says that to his close friends – to those who can assimilate
it. The jailer, though, he indulges as he would a child.
I 30 How to prepare for trouble
 In the event that you are haled before someone wielding the
reigns of power, remember that there is somebody else looking
down from above, and you have to answer rst to him.  So he
examines you: ‘How did you categorize exile, imprisonment, chains,
death and disgrace, when you were in school?’
‘I said they were indierent.’
 ‘And what do you call them now? They haven’t changed, I
presume?’
‘No.’
‘Well, have you changed?’
‘No.’
‘Then dene for me now what the “indierents” are.’
‘Whatever things we cannot control.’∗
‘Tell me the upshot.’
‘They are nothing to me.’
 ‘Remind me what you thought was good.’
‘The will and the right use of impressions.’†
‘And the goal of life is what?’
‘To follow God.’
 ‘And do you stand by that now?’
‘I say it even now.’
‘Go, then, in condence, holding fast to these convictions. You’ll
see what it’s like to be a young person with an education, alongside
people who have none.  I promise that you will feel somewhat
like this: “Why do we serve such a long and dicult apprenticeship
– in preparation to face nonentities?  Is this what ‘authority’
meant? Are the courtyards, the palace sta, the guards no more
than this? Was this why I sat through so many lectures? It all
amounts to nothing – and I was expecting to be overwhelmed.” ’
BOOK II
II 1 That condence does not conict with caution
 To some people, perhaps, what we philosophers say will appear
impossible. But let us investigate, all the same, whether it’s true that
in our daily lives we can act with both caution and condence. 
It seems impossible because the two are evidently opposites – and
opposites (supposedly) cannot coexist. But what most people
consider strange I think can be explained on the following
hypothesis:  if we are talking about using condence and caution
on the same objects, we might fairly be accused of trying to
reconcile irreconcilables. But our claim does not involve anything so
strange.
 We have often said, and shown, that the use of impressions
represents for us the essence of good and evil, and that good and
evil have to do with the will alone. And if that is true,  then
nothing is impractical in the philosophers’ advice to ‘Be condent in
everything outside the will, and cautious in everything under the
will’s control.’  For if evil is a matter of the will, then caution is
needed there; and if everything beyond the will and not in our
control is immaterial to us, then those things can be approached
with condence.  And so, you see, that’s how we can be cautious
and condent at the same time – and, in fact, condent owing to
our caution. For, being on our guard against evils, we approach
things whose nature is not evil in a spirit of assurance.
 Instead, however, we act like deer. When deer are frightened
by the feathers, they seek safety in the hunters’ nets.1 Confusing
ruin with refuge, they come to an ill-timed death.  Similarly, fear
aicts us in matters outside the will’s control, while we act
condently and casually in matters dependent on the will as if they
were of no importance.  To be deceived or rash, to act
shamelessly or with unbridled lust – none of this matters to us as
long as we have success in aairs outside the will. Death, exile, pain
and ill repute – there you will nd the impulse to tremble and run
away.
 So, you would expect when error involves the things of
greatest importance, our natural condence is perverted into
rashness, thoughtlessness, recklessness and shamelessness. At the
same time, all fear and agitation, we exchange our natural caution
and reserve for meekness and timidity.  Transfer caution to the
will and the functions of the will, and the mere wish will bring with
it the power of avoidance. But if we direct it at what is outside us
and is none of our responsibility, wanting instead to avoid what’s in
the control of others, we are necessarily going to meet with fear,
upset and confusion.  Death and pain are not frightening, it’s
the fear of pain and death we need to fear. Which is why we praise
the poet who wrote, ‘Death is not fearful, but dying like a coward
is.’
 So be condent about death, and caution yourself against the
fear of it – just the opposite, in other words, of what we are doing
now. Now we shrink from death, whereas our views about death
hardly concern us, we hardly give them a thought, and are
completely apathetic.  Socrates used to call such fears
‘hobgoblins’,2 and rightly so; just as masks scare and frighten
children since they haven’t seen them before, we react to events in
much the same way and for much the same reason. 
What is a child? Ignorance and inexperience. But with respect to
what it knows, a child is every bit our equal.  What is death? A
scary mask. Take it o – see, it doesn’t bite. Eventually, body and
soul will havetoseparate, justasthey existed separately before we
were born. So why be upset if it happens now? If it isn’t now, it’s
later.  And why now, if that happens to be the case? To
accommodate the world’s cycle; because the world needs things to
come into being now, things to come into being later – and it needs
things whose time is now complete.
 Pain too is just a scary mask: look under it and you will see.
The body sometimes suers, but relief is never far behind. And if
that isn’t good enough for you, the door stands open; otherwise put
up with it.  The door needs to stay open whatever the
circumstances, with the result that our problems disappear.3 
The fruit of these doctrines is the best and most beautiful, as it
ought to be for individuals who are truly educated: freedom from
trouble, freedom from fear – freedom in general.  The masses
are wrong to say that only freeborn men are entitled to an
education; believe the philosophers instead, who say that only
educated people are entitled to be called free.  I will explain.
What else is freedom but the power to live our life the way we
want?
‘Nothing.’
Do you want to live life doing wrong?
‘No.’
Therefore, no one doing wrong is free.  Do you want to live
your life in fear, grief and anxiety?
‘Of course not.’
So no one in a state of constant fear is free either. By the same
token, whoever has gained relief from grief, fear and anxiety has
gained freedom.  What condence, then, can we have in our
own dear legislators when they say that only freeborn people are
entitled to an education, when the philosophers contend that only
people already educated can be considered free? God will not allow
it, you see.
 ‘What about a master who performs the ceremony of
manumitting a slave? Is nothing accomplished by that?’
Certainly it is – the master has performed the ceremony; and, on
top of that, he has paid a ve per cent tax to the state.
 ‘But his slave – hasn’t he come by his freedom in the
process?’
No more than he has instantly come by peace of mind. I mean,
consider your own case: you have slaves, and the power to free
them.  But what master, I wonder, do you yourself serve?
Money? Women? Boys? The emperor or one of his subordinates? It
has to be one of them, or you wouldn’t fret about such things.
 This is why I so often repeat to you the need to think about
them and have these thoughts ready to hand, namely, the
knowledge of what you should treat with condence, and what you
should treat with caution – that you can treat with condence
whatever lies outside the will, but must treat with caution what lies
within.
 But you say, ‘Didn’t I read to you, and didn’t you take note
of my performance?’
 I noticed your clever phrases, yes – and you can have them.
Show me instead how you practise desire and aversion to get what
you want and avoid what you do not want. As for those treatises of
yours, if you have any sense, you will go and burn them.
 ‘But wasn’t Socrates a writer, and a prolic one at that?’4
Yes, but for what purpose? Since there wasn’t always someone
available whose ideas he could examine or who could examine
Socrates’ own in turn, sometimes he would test and examine
himself, forever subjecting to scrutiny one assumption or another.
 That’s the writing of a real philosopher; whereas pretty phrases
in dialogue form he leaves to others – aesthetes∗ and idlers who lie
about and have no patience with logical reasoning because they’re
too stupid.
 Even now, if the opportunity presents itself, I know you will
go o to read and make public those compositions, and you’ll pride
yourself on being uent in the dialogue form.  Don’t do it, man.
What I would rather hear from you is, ‘Look how I don’t fail in my
desires, or have experiences I don’t want. I’ll prove it to you in the
case of death, I’ll prove it to you in the case of physical pain, in the
case of prison, of condemnation, and ill repute.’ That’s the real test
of a youth t to nish school.  Forget about that other stu,
don’t let people hear you giving public recitations; and even if
someone praises you, restrain yourself, be content to look like a
nobody or know-nothing.
 Show them this, though, that you know how not to fail in
your desires or experience what you don’t desire.  Let others
practise lawsuits, solve logical puzzles or syllogisms. Your duty is to
prepare for death and imprisonment, torture and exile –  and all
such evils – with condence, because you have faith in the one who
has called on you to face them, having judged you worthy of the
role. When you take on the role, you will show the superiority of
reason and the mind over forces unconnected with the will. 
Then that paradox will no longer seem so paradoxical or absurd –
that we should be condent and cautious at the same time:
condent in relation to things outside the will, cautious about things
within.
II 2 On tranquillity
 If you are headed to court, consider carefully what it is you
want to keep and in what area you want to win.  If you want to
keep your character in line with nature, you have every hope of
success, all the means you need, and not a worry in the world. 
Because if you want to keep what is yours by right and is by nature
free – and these are the only things you want – you have nothing to
worry about. No one else controls them or can take them away from
you.  If you want to be a man of honour and a man of your word,
who is going to stop you? You say you don’t want to be obstructed
or forced to do something against your will – well, who is going to
force you to desire things that you don’t approve, or dislike
something against your better judgement?
 Ah, but they will threaten you with punishments that overawe
you. But how can they make you think of those suerings as
something you are obligated to avoid?  As long as desire and
aversion are under your control, there is nothing more to worry
about.  There is your opening statement, your exposition, your
proof – and there lies success, the last word, and acquittal. 
Which is why Socrates, when he was told to prepare himself for
trial, said, ‘Haven’t I been preparing for it my whole life?’ 
Preparing for it how? ‘I’ve tended to my own aairs, and never done
anything in violation of the law, either publicly or privately.’
 If, however, you want to keep hold of externals – your body,
belongings and reputation – then my advice to you is that your
preparations better begin early and will have to be long. You will
need to research the character of the judge, of course, and make a
study of your opponent too.  If grovelling is called for, then be
prepared to grovel – to weep and holler too.  Whenever
externals are more important to you than your own integrity, then
be prepared to serve them the remainder of your life. Don’t hedge
and agree to be their slave, then change your mind later; 
commit to one or the other position at once and without reserve.
Choose to be either free or a slave, enlightened or a fool, a
thoroughbred or a nag. Either resign yourself to a life of abuse till
you die, or escape it immediately. For God’s sake, don’t put up with
years of abuse, and then change your mind!  This humiliation
can be avoided before it begins: just decide now what you think is
truly good and bad.∗
 I mean, do you think that, if Socrates had any concern for
what others could do to him, he would have stood before the court
and said, ‘Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but cannot harm me’?
 Do you think he was fool enough not to see that this approach
was going to lead to a very dierent result?5 So why not make
remarks that are more provocative?†
 It’s like my friend Heraclitus,6 who had a lawsuit about a
piece of property on Rhodes. After proving to the jury that he had
right on his side, he came to his concluding remarks and said, ‘But I
am not going to plead with you, and I don’t care what you decide.
You are more on trial here than I am.’ With the result that he
sabotaged his case.  And why was it necessary? Don’t plead –
but don’t go on to say, ‘I won’t plead’ – not unless there is a point in
provoking the jurors deliberately, as in Socrates’ case.  As for
you, if you’re planning some such parting shot, why bother to speak
at all, why even show up at court?  Because if you want to be
crucied, just wait, and the cross will come. But if reason demands
that you appear and do your best to be persuasive, you must do
what is entailed – while safeguarding what is yours.
 Thus, it is stupid to say, ‘Tell me what to do!’7 What should I
tell you? It would be better to say, ‘Make my mind adaptable to any
circumstance.’  Saying ‘Tell me what to do’ is like an illiterate
saying, ‘Tell me what to write whenever I’m presented with a name.’
 If I say ‘John’ and then someone else comes along and gives
him ‘Jane’ instead of ‘John’ to write, what is going to happen? How
is he going to write it?  If you have learned your letters, though,
you are ready for anything anyone dictates. If you are not prepared,
I don’t know what I should tell you to do. Because there may be
events that call for you to act dierently – and what will you do or
say then?  So hold on to this general principle8 and you won’t
need specic advice. If you hanker after externals you are going to
be twirled round and round at the will of your master.  ‘Who’s
my “master”?’ Whoever controls what you desire or dislike.
II 3 Addressed to people who recommend others to
philosophers
 It was a shrewd reply that Diogenes9
 gave the person who asked
him for a letter of reference: ‘The person whose favour you seek will
know that you’re human as soon as he sees you; as to whether
you’re a good or a bad one – well, either he’s a competent judge of
character or he isn’t. If he is, he can decide that on his own too, and
if he’s not, a thousand letters from me aren’t going to make him one.
 A coin might as well ask for a recommendation to get someone
to declare it genuine. If that someone is trained in distinguishing
authentic coins from counterfeit, it will speak for itself.’
 And so it is in life. We need standards such as exist in the case
of silver, so that we can make a similar claim as the assayer’s: ‘Bring
me any coin at all, I will tell you whether or not it’s genuine.’ 
Instead, it is in analysing syllogisms that we like to be able to say,
‘Bring me any you like, and I can judge whether it is or is not
analytic.’10 Why? Because we know how to analyse arguments, and
have the skill a person needs to evaluate competent logicians. 
But in life what do I do? What today I say is good tomorrow I will
swear is bad. And the reason is that, compared to what I know
about syllogisms, my knowledge and experience of life fall far
behind.
II 4 Addressed to someone who had been caught
cheating on his wife
 Epictetus was saying that, as human beings, we are born to be
faithful to one another, and that whoever denies this denies their
humanity. Just then, a well-known scholar entered the room – one
who had been caught in adultery while in Rome.  So Epictetus
continued, ‘But what are we really doing when we throw away our
innate faithfulness, to intrigue with our neighbour’s wife? We are
ruining and destroying – well, what? How about the man of trust,
principle and piety that once was?  And is that all? Aren’t we
also ruining the idea of neighbourliness, friendship and community?
What position are we putting ourselves in? How am I supposed to
deal with you now? As a neighbour? A friend? Some friend! A
fellow citizen? But how can a fellow citizen like you be trusted?
 ‘Look, if you were a bowl so leaky that you were good for
nothing any more, you would be tossed in the rubbish dump, and no
one would take the trouble to pick you out.  What are we going
to do with a human who can’t ll the most basic human role? Fine,
you can’t function as a friend; how would you do as a slave? Who
would have any condence in you, though, even in that capacity?
So how would you like to be tossed in the rubbish too, like a leaky
bowl – like dung?
 ‘Then you are heard to say, “No one gives me any respect as a
man of letters.” That’s because you’re a vile and worthless human
being! It’s as if wasps were to protest that they get no respect;
everyone runs away from them, some people will even swat them,
given the chance.  Your prick is such as to infect everyone you
sting with heartache and aggravation. What would you have us do
with you? There isn’t any place you will t.
 ‘Hold it, though – doesn’t nature intend women to be shared?
11 I grant it – but in the way a roast is shared among dinner guests.
Very well, after each guest has received his share, if you feel like it,
why not grab your neighbour’s portion too? Steal it when he’s not
looking, or just stretch out your hand and grab all you can manage
to put away. If you can’t actually snatch the meat, at least wipe your
hands on it, and lick the grease o your ngers. What ne company
you will make -just like Socrates’ fellow diners in the Symposium.’12
 ‘Well, what about the theatre – it’s open to all citizens, is it
not?’
‘Sure, so when everyone has taken their seats, just come along
and throw somebody out of theirs.  That, you may say, is how
women are common property too.
‘Look, try this instead: when the judge, like the host at a private
party, has assigned them, be satised to claim your own share, don’t
be a glutton and steal someone else’s. “But I’m a scholar who
understands Archedemus!”  You can understand Archedemus
and still be an adulterer and a cheater, a wolf or an ape rather than
a human being; what’s to stop you?’
II 5 How condence and carefulness are compatible
 Material things per se are indierent, but the use we make of
them is not indierent.  The question, then, is how to strike a
balance between a calm and composed attitude on the one hand,
and a conscientious outlook that is neither slack nor careless on the
other.13 Model yourself on card players.  The chips don’t matter,
and the cards don’t matter; how can I know what the deal will be?
But making careful and skilful use of the deal – that’s where my
responsibility begins.14  So in life our rst job is this, to divide
and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot
control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control.
Where will I nd good and bad?  In me, in my choices. Don’t
ever speak of ‘good’ or ‘bad’, ‘advantage’ or ‘harm’, and so on, of
anything that is not your responsibility.
 ‘Well, does that mean that we shouldn’t care how we use
them?’
Not at all. In fact, it is morally wrong not to care, and contrary to
our nature.  Be careful how you use them, because it’s not
unimportant – but at the same time be calm and composed, because
things in themselves don’t matter.  Where it does matter, no one
can compel me or stand in my way. And where I can be stopped or
compelled, well, getting those things is not in my control – and not
good or bad in any case. But the way I use them is good or bad, and
depends on me.
 It isn’t easy to combine and reconcile the two – the
carefulness of a person devoted to externals and the dignity of one
who’s detached – but it’s not impossible. Otherwise happiness would
be impossible.15  It’s something like going on an ocean voyage.
What can I do? Pick the captain, the boat, the date, and the best
time to sail.  But then a storm hits. Well, it’s no longer my
business; I have done everything I could. It’s somebody else’s
problem now – namely the captain’s.  But then the boat actually
begins to sink. What are my options? I do the only thing I am in a
position to do, drown – but fearlessly, without bawling or crying out
to God, because I know that what is born must also die.  I am
not Father Time; I’m a human being, a part of the whole, like an
hour in a day. Like the hour I must abide my time, and like the
hour, pass.  What dierence does it make whether I go by
drowning or disease? I have to go somehow.
 You will nd that skilled ballplayers do the same thing. It’s
not the ball they value, it’s how well they throw and catch it that
counts as good or bad.  That is where the grace and skill lie, the
speed and expertise – speed such that I can’t catch one of their
throws even if I spread out my coat to do it, and skill such that, if I
throw the ball, however badly, one of them is bound to catch it.
 If we are afraid to throw the ball, or nervous about catching it,
then the fun is lost; and how can we preserve our composure when
we are uncertain about what next to do? ‘Throw it,’ someone says,
‘Don’t throw it,’ another says, ‘Throw it already!’ says someone else.
It turns into a shouting instead of a sporting match.16
 Socrates, you might say, knew how to play ball. In his case,
the arena was the courtroom. ‘Tell me, Anytus,’ he said, ‘how can
you say I don’t believe in God? We are agreed, are we not, that
there are minor gods and heroes – the children of gods or the mixed
issue of gods and men?’  Anytus conceded the point. ‘Well, if
someone acknowledged that there were animals of mixed parentage
– half breeds such as mules – don’t you think they would also have
to believe in the existence of horses or asses – the creatures that
produced them?’17  It’s just as if the man were playing ball.
Only the ball in his case was life, imprisonment, exile or execution –
with the prospect of losing his wife, and having his children reduced
to the status of orphans. Those were the stakes of the game, and still
he played, and handled the ball with aplomb.
 That’s what we need: the star athlete’s concentration,
together with his coolness, as if it were just another ball we were
playing with too. To be sure, external things of whatever kind
require skill in their use, but we must not grow attached to them;
whatever they are, they should only serve for us to show how
skilled we are in our handling of them.
It’s like weaving: the weaver does not make the wool, he makes
the best use of whatever wool he’s given.  God gives you food
and property, and can take them back – your body too. Work with
the material you are given.  If you come through all right, most
people you meet will congratulate you on surviving. A shrewd
judge, however, will praise you and share in your pleasure only if he
sees that you acted honourably in the case; not, however, if he sees
that your success was owed to anything dishonest. When happiness
is come by fairly, others are happy for us too.
 ‘Then how are some externals said to be in accordance with
nature, others contrary to nature?’18 That only applies to us
considered separately. I agree that for my foot it is in accordance
with its nature to be clean; but considered as a foot and not
separately, it is right and proper for it to tramp through mud, step
on needles – there may even be a time when it will have to be
amputated for the sake of the body as a whole. It wouldn’t be a foot
otherwise.
We have to assume that a similar distinction applies to us
personally.  What are you? A human being. If you think of
yourself as a unit apart, then it is in accordance with your nature to
live to old age, to be rich, and be healthy. But if your view of
yourself involves being part of a whole, then, for the sake of the
whole, circumstances may make it right for you to be sick, go on a
dangerous journey, endure poverty, even die before your time. Don’t
complain;  just as it would not be a foot, don’t you realize that
in isolation you would not be a human being? Because what is a
human being? Part of a community – the community of gods and
men, primarily, and secondarily that of the city we happen to
inhabit, which is only a microcosm of the universe in toto.
 ‘And that’s why now I’m being put on trial?’ And why
someone else falls sick, why another undertakes a voyage, why
someone else dies, and still another is convicted. In this body, this
universe, this community, it is inevitable that each of us faces some
such event.  Your job, then, is to appear before the court, say
what you have to say and make the best of the situation.  Then
the judge declares you guilty. ‘I wish you well, judge. I did my part,
you can decide if you did yours.’ Because the judge runs a risk too,
don’t forget.
II 6 On ‘indierence’19
 The conjunctive argument20 is indierent, but how you handle it
is not indierent; it is tantamount to knowledge, opinion, or
ignorance. In the same way, life is indierent, but the use we make
of it is not indierent.  So when you hear that even life and the
like21 are indierent, don’t become apathetic; and by the same
token, when you’re advised to care about them, don’t become
supercial and conceive a passion for externals.
 It is good to be clear about the level of your talent and
training. That way, when unfamiliar topics arise, you will know
enough to keep still, and not be put out if there are students more
advanced than you.  You will show your own superiority in logic;
and if others are disconcerted over that, mollify them by saying,
‘Well, I had a good teacher.’  The same applies to subjects that
require some practical training; don’t pretend you have a particular
skill if you don’t yet; yield to whoever has the requisite experience;
and for your own part take satisfaction in an awareness that your
persistence is helping you become expert in the subject yourself.
 ‘Go pay so-and-so your respects.’
‘I call on him – but not on my knees.’
‘And you were not let in.’
‘Well, you see, I don’t know how to break through windows.
When I nd the door shut, either I have to go through the window
or leave.’
 ‘So, talk to him.’
‘OK, I talk to him.’
‘How?’
‘As an equal.’
 But you did not get what you wanted – because of course that
was up to him, not you. So don’t take responsibility for it. Always
remember what is yours, and what belongs to other people, and you
won’t have trouble.  Apropos, Chrysippus said: ‘As long as the
future is uncertain to me I always hold to those things which are
better adapted to obtaining the things in accordance with nature; for
God himself has made me disposed to select them.  But if I
knew that my destiny at present was to fall ill, I would even wish
for it. My foot, too, if it had intelligence, would volunteer to get
muddy.’
 Look, isn’t wheat grown for the express purpose of turning
brown, and doesn’t it turn brown in preparation for being
harvested? It is not grown for its own sake.  If it could talk, I
suppose it would beg never to be harvested? Come, that’s actually a
curse we put on people’s crop, that it not be brought to harvest.
 Know that for humans, too, it’s no less of a curse not to die –
the same as ‘Please, God, don’t let their wheat ripen, don’t let it be
brought in.’  But because we’re the only animals who not only
die but are conscious of it even while it happens, we are beset by
anxiety. The reason can only be that we do not know who we are,
and have not studied what it means to be a human being – the way
horse trainers, for instance, learn the ways of horses.
 Look at Chrysantas, though: just as he was poised to stab an
enemy combatant he heard the trumpet sound retreat and froze;
that’s how much he set the captain’s will above his personal
welfare.22  Yet even when fate calls, not one of us is prepared to
obey. We suer what we suer not willingly, but with sobs of
protest, and call it all ‘circumstances’.  What are circumstances?
If by that you mean your situation, everything is ‘circumstances’.
But if you mean ‘problems’, where’s the problem in something that
was born, dying?  Death could come by way of a knife, torture,
the sea, a piece of masonry, a despot – why do you care? ‘All roads
to Hades are of equal length.’23  Well, to tell you the truth,
death by despot is less protracted. No despot ever took six months to
cut a throat, whereas a fatal illness often lasts a year.
‘Circumstances’, ‘troubles’ – this is all a lot of noise and a clamour of
meaningless names.
 You say, ‘I risk execution by the emperor.’
I face no less a danger here in Nicopolis, where earthquakes are a
common occurrence. As to you, aren’t you risking your life every
time you cross the Adriatic?
 ‘But even one’s opinions can get one into trouble here in
Rome.’
Do you mean your own? No one can force you to hold an opinion
against your will. And if you are referring to other people’s, how can
their wrong opinions pose any danger to you?
 ‘I also face the danger of exile.’
What is exile? Being somewhere other than Rome?
‘Exactly. My God, what if I’m sent to Gyara?’ Well, if that’s
tolerable for you, you will go; if not, you have the choice of another
destination, the place even the person who sent you to Gyara is
headed, whether they like it or not.
 So why make such a big deal of going to trial? It isn’t worth
all the preparation. A young man with any talent might well say, ‘I
wasted my time listening to so many lectures, writing so many
compositions, and sitting for so long next to an old man who didn’t
amount to much himself.’
 There is only one thing you need to remember, the rule that
distinguishes what is yours from what isn’t. Don’t ever lay claim to
anything belonging to others.  Court and prison are two places,
one high, the other low. Your character, however, can be kept the
same in either place – if you decide it should.  We will rival
Socrates when we can spend our time in prison composing hymns.
 But considering our attitude up to now, I wonder if in prison
we could even stand someone else oering to read us his own
compositions.
‘Don’t bother me; don’t you realize the problems I’ve got?∗ You
think I can listen to poetry in my position?’
‘Why, what is it?’
‘I’m sentenced to death!’
‘And the rest of us aren’t?’
II 8 What is the substance of the good?
 God is helpful. Whatever is good is also helpful. It is reasonable
to suppose, then, that the divine nature and the nature of the good
will correspond.  So what is the divine nature? Is it esh? Be
serious. Do we associate it with real estate and status? Hardly. It is
mind, intelligence and correct reason.
 So look no further than there for the substance of the good. Of
course, you won’t nd it in plants and animals. In man, however, it
consists in just those qualities that distinguish him from other
animals.  Since plants do not even have the power of perception,
‘good’ and ‘evil’ are not applicable to them. Evidently, ‘good’ and
‘bad’ presume the power of using impressions.  But is that
enough? If it is, then you must speak of ‘good’ in connection with
animals besides man, as well as ‘happy’ and ‘unhappy’ –  but
there is a very good reason that you don’t. Because, however well
they may use impressions, animals lack the ability to reect on
them. Nor should they have it, since they were bornto serve, not
command.  Is the donkey in a position of command? It was
created because man needed an animal with a strong back able to
carry big loads; the creature had to be able to walk, as well. Which
is why it was endowed with the power of using impressions –
otherwise it couldn’t walk. And that is about the extent of its
endowments.  After all, if the donkey had also acquired the
ability to reect on its use of impressions, it would quite rightly
refuse to obey us and serve our needs. It would, in fact, be
mankind’s equal and peer.
 So if it is absent from plants and animals, it’s only logical that
you should look for the nature of the good where you ordinarily
apply the word.  True, they are God’s creatures too, but not
creatures placed in a position of authority, not parts of God. 
You, on the other hand, are a creature placed in charge, and a
particle of God himself; there is a bit of God within you.
 Why don’t you know of this relation, and of your origins?
When you eat, bear in mind who it is exactly you are feeding. When
you have sex, reect who you are during the act. In conversation,
exercise, discourse – do you remember that it is God you are
feeding, God you are exercising? You carry God around with you
and don’t know it, poor fool.  Don’t imagine I am talking about
some external deity made of silver or gold. You carry the living God
inside you and are blind to the fact that you desecrate him with
your dirty words and dirty thoughts –  none of which you
would dare repeat if there were even a mere statue of a god near by.
God himself is there within, seeing and overhearing everything you
do and say – and do you care? You pariah, you have no sense of
your own heritage.
 What are we anxious about when we graduate a young man
from school and out into the real world? That he will make
mistakes, eat poorly, have sexual aairs, humiliate himself and go
around in rags, or else aect the latest fashions. And why? 
Because he is ignorant of his personal god and does not realize who
goes with him when he leaves school and his former friends. Yet we
indulge him when he writes to us to say, ‘I wish you here with me.’
 You have God there with you – who else do you need?
Whoever you invite to come and visit – would they tell you any
dierent?
 Suppose you were one of Phidias’ statues – his Zeus or his
Athena.24 You would certainly have a sense of who you were then,
and of who brought you into being. And if you had a brain, you
would make an eort to avoid doing anything that would bring
shame on either your creator or yourself, such as being caught in an
embarrassing position by the spectators come to see you.  But
Zeus has created you; shouldn’t that make you even more careful
about the impression you make? What is Phidias compared to Zeus?
How, for that matter, can their creations be compared?  What
other work of art comes ready equipped with the very powers the
artist displayed in making it? Do marble statues? No, nor do bronze,
gold or ivory ones. The Athena of Phidias, once its arm was raised to
support the statue of Victory, has maintained that pose for the
duration of its long existence. Zeus’ works, on the other hand, are
living, breathing creatures, with the power of perception and
judgement.
 He made you, and you mock him. Why? He not only made
you; of all his creatures, you alone were given the power of selfdetermination.  You not only ignore that, you bring shame on
the faith he placed in you. You would not have been so negligent in
caring for an orphan if God had put one in your way.  He has
entrusted you to yourself, saying, ‘I had no one more dependable
than you; just see that he keeps the qualities he was born with:
integrity, honour, dignity, patience, calmness and poise.’ But you
can’t even do that.
 However, there will be people who say, ‘Why is this person
so serious and self-important?’ If it seems like pretension, it’s only
because I don’t have complete condence in the principles that I’ve
learned and espouse. I still fear for my own frailty.  But grant
me the condence, and I will show you the right look and bearing;
then you will see the nished statue all bright and gleaming. 
And don’t expect a study in smugness. After all, the Zeus at Olympia
does not project an air of hauteur. He looks at us right in the eye –
just the way one ought to look when on the point of saying: ‘My
word is true and irrevocable.’25
 That is the sort of person you’ll nd I am: trustworthy,
honourable, noble and poised.  Not, to be sure, immune to
death, age or disease, like God, but still prepared to die and face
illness with a godlike dignity.  That much is mine to do, even if
I cannot accomplish the rest.
In short, I will show you that I have the strength – of a
philosopher. ‘And what strength would that be?’ A will that never
fails to get what it wants, a faculty of aversion that always avoids
what it dislikes, proper impulse, careful purpose and disciplined
assent. That’s the human specimen you should prepare yourselves to
see.
II 10 Social roles as a guide to conduct
 Who are you? In the rst place, a human being, which is to say,
a being possessed of no greater faculty than free choice, with all
your other faculties subordinate to it, choice itself being unconned
and independent.  Next, consider the gift of reason: it sets you
apart from wild animals; it sets you apart from sheep.  By virtue
of these two faculties you are a member of the universe with full
citizen rights; you were born not to serve but to govern, because
you understand the divine order and its pattern.
 Now, what does the title ‘citizen’ mean? In this role, a person
never acts in his own interest or thinks of himself alone, but, like a
hand or foot that had sense and realized its place in the natural
order, all its actions and desires aim at nothing except contributing
to the common good.  Therefore, philosophers rightly say, ‘If a
good person knew that sickness, death or disability lay in his future,
he would actually invite them, because he realizes that this is part
of the universal plan and that the universe has precedence over a
constituent, and the city over any one citizen.  But since we don’t
know the future, we’re justied in sticking to things that are
preferable by nature, because this, after all, is our instinct from
birth.’
 Next, remember that you are somebody’s son. What does this
social role mean? It means regarding everything of yours as
belonging to your father as well, always letting him have his way,
never trying to hurt him with your words or actions, or griping
about him behind his back. Defer to him at every opportunity, and
in the same spirit cooperate with him as best you can.
 Next, know that you are a brother. This role also calls for
deference, respect and civility. Never get into family ghts over
material things; give them up willingly, and your moral standing
will increase in proportion.  Make a gift of your box seat in the
theatre, or a bit of food, if that’s at stake, and see the gratitude you
get in return – how much greater it is than the sacrice.
 Finally, reect on the other social roles you play. If you are a
council member, consider what a council member should do. If you
are young, what does being young mean, if you are old, what does
age imply,  if you are a father, what does fatherhood entail?
Each of our titles, when reected upon, suggests the acts
appropriate to it.
 If you go o and yell at your brother, my reaction is to say,
‘You’ve forgotten who you are and what you stand for.’  I mean,
if you were a metalworker who fumbled with his tools, you would
have lost touch with the metalworker you once were. If you forget
what it means to be a brother and become your brother’s enemy,
don’t think you’ve made a trivial exchange.  If you are
transformed from a decent, social human being into some mean,
snarling, dangerous beast, is there no loss involved? Or do you have
to lose money before you feel penalized? Is losing money the only
loss that counts with us?
 If you lost the capacity to read, or play music, you would
think it was a disaster, but you think nothing of losing the capacity
to be honest, decent and civilized.  Yet those other misfortunes
come from some outside cause, while these are your own fault.
Moreover, it is neither honourable to have those other abilities nor
dishonourable to lose them, whereas it is dishonourable to lose these
capacities and a misfortune for which we have only ourselves to
blame.  A catamite is deprived of his manhood, his seducer is
no longer the man he was either, and is compromised in a hundred
other ways besides.  An adulterer does away with a just, decent
and honourable human being – the good neighbour and citizen he
might have been. A sorehead incurs one kind of loss, a coward
another –  but no one is bad without loss or penalty of some
kind.
Now, if you look for their penalty in terms of money, you might
nd them all safe and scot-free; they could even be helped and
rewarded for their oence if they gain by it nancially.  But, if
money is your only standard, then consider that, by your lights,
someone who loses their nose does not suer any harm.
‘Yes they do, they’re maimed physically.’
 But what if they are deprived just of the sense of smell – in
other words, isn’t there an associated psychic faculty, which is good
to have and a misfortune to lose?
 ‘What do you mean by “psychic faculty”?’
Aren’t we born with a sense of fairness?
‘We are.’
If you destroy it, is there no harm, is nothing sacriced, don’t we
lose something dear?  Don’t we have an innate sense of honour,
a sense of benevolence, a sense of kindness and compassion? Well, if
someone willingly parts with these sensibilities, do you suppose they
go unpunished and unhurt?
 ‘Well, does that mean that if someone wrongs me I shouldn’t
hurt them in return?’ First of all, look at what wrongdoing is and
remember what you have heard about it from philosophers.26 
Because if ‘good’ as well as ‘bad’ really relate to our choices, then
consider whether your position does not amount to saying
something like,  ‘Well, since that guy hurt himself with the
injustice he did me, shouldn’t I wrong him in order to hurt myself in
retaliation?’
 So why don’t we actually picture it to ourselves this way?
Instead, we see injury only where physical or nancial loss is
incurred, whereas if the loss stems from our own choices, then we
don’t suspect any harm has been done.  After all, we don’t get a
headache after an error in judgement or an act of injustice; we don’t
get eye trouble or stomach ache, we don’t lose property.  And
for us those are the only things that matter. As to whether our
character will remain loyal and honest, or become false and
depraved, we don’t care about that in the least – except insofar as it
comes up for examination in school;  the result being that our
debating skills improve at the cost of our character.
II 11 Starting philosophy
 People who come to philosophy the right way – by the front
door, as it were – begin by acknowledging their own faults and
limitations in areas of most urgency.  The isosceles triangle and
the half-tone or quarter-tone scale – we have no knowledge
pertaining to these subjects when we come into the world. We have
to learn about them later through specialized training; with the
result that no one untrained in these subjects pretends to know
about them.
 The situation is otherwise in the case of our ideas about good
and bad, right and wrong, appropriate and inappropriate, happiness,
duty, and obligation. We are born with an innate understanding of
what these words mean.  So everyone uses them, which is to say,
everyone tries to apply the related preconceptions to specic things.
 ‘Her action was good, it was her duty, it was not her duty, she
was fortunate, she was not fortunate, she is honest, she is
dishonest…’ You hear such phrases all the time, because no one is in
any doubt about how to use the words. No one feels they have to
wait to be told their meaning, the way we once had to learn our
letters or be taught how words are pronounced.  The reason is
that we come into the world knowing some things that nature, you
might say, has taught us already; and, building on this knowledge,
we come to form our opinions.
 ‘Well, whatever you may say, I know good from bad, and have
an idea of the good.’
You have one, I allow.
‘And I put it into practice.’
You use it in specic instances, yes.
‘And I use it correctly.’
 Well, that’s the crux, because this is where opinions become
an issue. Starting with the ideas we take for granted, we get into
arguments whenever we apply them incorrectly.  If, along with
the innate ideas, we came into the world with knowledge of how
they should be applied, we would be perfect wise men from the
moment we were born.
 Now, you think that you do possess this extra knowledge of
how to apply preconceptions in particular instances. How did you
come by it?
‘It’s my opinion.’
But someone else has a dierent opinion, and also believes that he
is the one applying his preconceptions correctly. Am I right?
‘I guess so.’
 And if you clash over the application of preconceptions, you
can’t both be using them correctly.
‘Agreed.’
 Well, can you come up with a better aid to their application
than your opinion? I mean, a lunatic acts in accordance with his
own opinion of what is good; but in his case can it function as an
adequate guide?
‘No.’
So let’s move beyond opinion; is there nothing better?
 Here you have philosophy’s starting point: we nd that
people cannot agree among themselves, and we go in search of the
source of their disagreement. In time, we come to scorn and dismiss
simple opinion, and look for a way to determine if an opinion is
right or wrong. At last, we focus on nding a standard that we can
invoke, just as the scale was invented to measure weights, and the
carpenter’s rule devised to distinguish straight from crooked. 
That is the beginning of philosophy.
Are everyone’s opinions correct? How can they be, when some
conict?
 ‘All right, not all are correct. But ours are.’
Well, why ours instead of the Syrians’ or Egyptians’ – why mine
rather than those of any person picked at random?
‘No reason.’
Therefore, the fact that someone holds this or that opinion will
not suce to make it true, any more than we are inclined to trust a
person’s word in dealing with weights and measures. In both cases,
we have developed an objective standard instead.  So is there
no standard for our case beyond opinion? Is it only humanity’s most
important values that are going to remain vague and subjective?
 There must be one. So let’s hunt for it; and once we’ve found it,
let’s commit to never making a single move without reference to it.
 I conceive this discovery as the antidote to the madness that
results from exclusive reliance on opinion as the criterion of truth.
And from then on, starting with the familiar preconceptions, clearly
dened, we will proceed to apply them to particular objects and
events in a methodical manner.
 Name me a subject for discussion now.
‘Pleasure.’
 All right, put it to the test, lay it on the scales. For something
to be good, it must be something we can rely on and trust.
‘I agree.’
Well, can we trust anything that comes and goes?
‘No.’
 And is pleasure constant?
‘No.’
Then take it out of the scale and banish it from the realm of
goods.
 But if you’re none too sharp and missed it the rst time, let’s
try a dierent test. Something good should be a source of pride,
correct?
‘Yes.’
And can one really take pride in a momentary pleasure? Please
don’t say yes, or I will think you barely deserve to be regarded on
the same level as draft animals.
 That is the way things are weighed and disagreements
settled – when standards are established.  Philosophy aims to
test and set such standards.  And the wise man is advised to
make use of their ndings right away.
II 12 On the art of argumentation
 The philosophers of our school have told us precisely what we
need to learn in order to know how to practise logical argument.
But when it comes to practising it correctly in a book ii particular
situation – there we have no experience at all.  Just give us a
random person to engage in dialogue and we won’t know what to
do with him. After asking the person a few questions, if we don’t get
the kinds of answer we expect, we throw up our hands and resort to
ridicule or verbal abuse, saying, ‘He’s not a philosopher, it just isn’t
possible to engage him in dialogue.’
 Well, when a guide meets up with someone who is lost,
ordinarily his reaction is to direct him on the right path, not mock
or malign him, then turn on his heel and walk away.  As for you,
lead someone to the truth and you will nd that he can follow.27
But as long as you don’t point it out to him, don’t make fun of him;
be aware of what you need to work on instead.
 Consider how Socrates behaved. He would compel whomever
he spoke with to voice their views, and one interlocutor was
enough. Which is why he could say, ‘Everyone else can go hang, I
am only interested in what the person I’m talking to has to say. No
one’s vote counts with me except that of my partner in dialogue.’28
 Socrates would lay out the implications of their views so
incisively that, regardless of who they were, they would all admit an
inconsistency and back o from it:
 ‘Is a man racked by envy happy?’
‘Not at all, they’re miserable.’∗
‘Miserable over something bad? But whoever heard of envy for
something bad?’
 Thus he made him say that envy is pain provoked by
something good.
‘I mean, would someone be envious over something he cared
nothing for?’
‘Obviously not.’29
 That is what Socrates would do: he would quit only after he
had eshed out an idea and explored its implications. He wouldn’t
just say, ‘Dene envy for me,’ then, when his discourses interlocutor
had ventured on a denition, say, ‘Wrong: your deniens is not
extensionally equivalent to the deniendum’ –  technical terms
which are incomprehensible and o – putting for the layman, and
which we can’t resist using for that very reason.  As for using
language that would enable even a non-philosopher, depending on
his view, to answer with a simple yes or no – well, we don’t know
how to engage anyone on that level.  And what happens is that
we realize that we can’t do it and give up the attempt – those of us
with any discretion, anyway.  Most people are impulsive,
however, and, having committed to the thing, they persist, just
making more confusion for themselves and others until it all ends in
mutual recrimination.
 Now that is the rst thing Socrates was known for – never
turning dialogue into dispute, never introducing rudeness or
invective, although he would put up with the insults of others in
order to avoid a ght.  And if you want to know how eective
he was, read Xenophon’s Symposium; you will see how many ghts
he is credited there with resolving.  Among the poets, too, one
of the highest forms of compliment is conveyed in the line:
He could cut short a quarrel, however great, with his diplomacy.30
 But nowadays engaging in logical dialogue is just not a very
safe business, in Rome especially. Because of course you can’t do it
o in a corner somewhere. You may nd yourself approaching a
senator, someone with money, and asking him: ‘Do you know, sir, to
whom you have entrusted the care of your horses?’
 ‘I do.’
‘Is it some random person with no knowledge of horses?’
‘Of course not.’
‘What about your money and clothes?’
‘I don’t hand them over to just anyone either.’
 ‘And as to your body, you’ve already found someone to
entrust with its care?’
‘Naturally.’
‘An expert, obviously, in either exercise or medicine?’
‘Yes.’
 ‘Are these the things you value most, or have you got
something better than them all?’
‘And what would that be?’
‘The faculty that uses all of them, and assigns each their place and
value.’
‘You mean the soul?’
 ‘Good guess; that’s precisely what I mean.’
‘Absolutely, I think that is far and away a more precious
possession than the others you mentioned.’
 ‘So, then, tell me the steps you’ve taken to care for the soul.
As intelligent as you are, and as politically prominent, surely you
would not casually look on and allow the most prized of your
possessions to be neglected and go to ruin.’
‘No, of course not.’
 ‘Well, if you have looked after it personally, did you learn
how from another person, or discover the means yourself?’
 At this point you run the risk of him saying, ‘What business
is that of yours, sir? What are you to me?’ Pester him further, and
he is liable to punch you in the nose.  I myself was once keen
for this sort of discourse, until I met with just such a reception.
II 13 On nerves
 Whenever I see a person suering from nervousness, I think,
well, what can he expect? If he had not set his sights on things
outside man’s control, his nervousness would end at once.  Take
a lyre player: he’s relaxed when he performs alone, but put him in
front of an audience, and it’s a dierent story, no matter how
beautiful his voice or how well he plays the instrument. Why?
Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well
received – and the latter lies outside his control.
 He is condent as far as his knowledge of music is concerned
– the views of the public carry no weight with him there. His
anxiety stems from lack of knowledge and lack of practice in other
areas. Which are what?  He doesn’t know what an audience is, or
what approval from an audience amounts to. Although he knows
well enough how to play every note on the guitar, from the lowest
to the highest, the approval of the public – what it means and what
real signicance it has – this he does not know and has made no
eort to learn.  Necessarily, then, he is going to get nervous and
grow pale. Now, I won’t go so far as to say that he’s not a true
musician if I see that he suers from stage fright. But I can say one
thing – several things, in fact.
 I can start by calling him a stranger and say, ‘This person has
no idea where he’s living, and for all his time in residence here still
doesn’t know the laws of the country or its customs. He does not
know what is permitted and what is not. Furthermore, he has never
taken the trouble to call on a lawyer who will tell him, and explain
how things operate here.  He won’t sign a contract without
knowing how to draft one properly, or hiring somebody who does.
He isn’t casual about signing for loans or oering guarantees. But
when it comes to desire, aversion, impulse, plans and projects, he
applies himself to all of these without benet of legal counsel. 
How do I know? He wants what he cannot have, and does not want
what he can’t refuse – and isn’t even aware of it. He doesn’t know
the dierence between his own possessions and others’. Because, if
he did, he would never be thwarted or disappointed.
Or nervous.
Just think:  we aren’t lled with fear except by things that are
bad; and not by them, either, as long as it is in our power to avoid
them.  So, if externals are neither good nor bad, while
everything within the sphere of choice is in our power and cannot
be taken away by anyone, or imposed on us without our compliance
– then what’s left to be nervous about?  We agonize over our
body, our money, or what the emperor is going to decree – never
about anything inside us.
I mean, do we worry whether we are going to make an error in
judgement? No, because it is under our control. Or having book ii
an unnatural urge? No again.  So if you see someone pale with
nerves, be like a doctor who diagnoses liver trouble based on a
patient’s yellow skin. Say, ‘This man’s desire and aversion are
unhealthy, they aren’t functioning properly, they’re infected. 
Because nothing else can account for his change in colour, his
shivering, his chattering teeth, and “this constant fretting and
shifting from foot to foot”.’31
 All of which explains why Zeno was not nervous about his
meeting with Antigonus.32 What Zeno valued Antigonus had no
power over, and as a philosopher he cared nothing for the things
that the king did command.  It was Antigonus who was anxious
before their meeting. Naturally – he wanted to make a good
impression, which was beyond his control. Zeno, for his part, had no
wish to please the king; no expert needs validation from an amateur.
 So what do I need your approval for? You don’t know the
measure of a man, you haven’t studied to learn what a good or a
bad person is, and how each one gets that way. No wonder you’re
not a good person yourself.
 ‘How do you make that out?’
It is not in a good person’s nature to grieve, complain or whine;
they don’t go pale, tremble and say, ‘What kind of hearing or
reception will he give me?’  Idiot, that’s his concern – don’t
concern yourself with other people’s business. It’s his problem if he
receives you badly.
‘True.’
And you cannot suer for another person’s fault. So don’t worry
about the behaviour of others.
 ‘All right, but I worry about how I will talk to him.’
Can’t you talk to him any way you like?
‘I’m afraid that I may say something gauche.’
 Look, when you are about to spell the name ‘Dion’, are you
afraid that you will slip up?
‘No.’
And why not? It’s because you have practice in writing the name.
‘True.’
And you would have the same condence reading it.
‘Yes.’
The reason is that any discipline brings with it a measure of
strength and condence in the corresponding arts.  Now, you
have practice speaking. What else did they teach you at school?
‘Syllogisms and changing arguments.’33
But why, if not to be accomplished in conversation? And by
accomplished I mean rened, assured, intelligent, not easily
ustered or refuted – and fearless, on top of all that.
‘Agreed.’
 Well, then, you are in the position of a soldier on horseback
who is about to face a mere foot soldier, on ground that you have
gone over and he has not. And still you’re nervous?
‘But he can literally kill me!’
 Well, then, speak the truth, you sorry specimen, don’t put on
airs and call yourself a philosopher. Face up to who your betters are.
As long as you have this attachment to the body, be ready to submit
to anyone or anything of superior physical force.
 As for speaking, Socrates must have practised the art, look at
his answer to the Thirty Tyrants, his defence before the jury, his
conversations in jail.34 Diogenes too had practised how to speak,
witness the free and easy way he talked to Alexander, Philip, the
pirates and the person to whom the pirates sold him as a slave.35∗
 As for you, go back to your work and don’t ever leave it. Settle
back in your alcove, think up new syllogisms, and share them with
your friends.  You are plainly not cut out for the role of public
leader.
II 14 To Naso36
 A visitor from Rome, together with his son, was present at one
of his lectures when Epictetus said, ‘This is the way I teach’ – then
abruptly stopped talking.  The man pleaded with him to go on,
but Epictetus said: The learning process is boring to anyone
completely new to, and unfamiliar with, a skill.  Now, the skill’s
nished product leaves no doubt as to its utility, most are even
pleasing or attractive.  It is not exciting, for instance, to follow
the progress of a shoemaker in his art, but shoes are not only useful,
they are usually aesthetically pleasing to a degree.  Or the
training of a carpenter – it is very tedious for people who are not
carpenters to watch, but the nished cabinetry justies the eort.
 Music makes my point most obviously: attend a music lesson,
and you will think it involves the most monotonous training of all.
But the results please and entertain everyone.
 In our school, we picture the philosopher’s goal more or less
as follows: bring the will in line with events, so that nothing
happens contrary to our wishes and, conversely, nothing fails to
happen that we want to happen.  Pursue it, and the reward is
that neither desire nor aversion will fail in their aims; and we will
ll all our roles in society – as son, father, brother, citizen, man,
woman, neighbour, fellow voyager, ruler or ruled – without conict,
fear or rancour.
 That is how we picture the philosopher’s goal. The next step is
nding how to make it reality.  Becoming a carpenter or pilot,
we realize, requires some formal training. Is it unreasonable to
suppose that it will take more than just the desire to be good or bad
– that the student of philosophy will also have to learn a few things
of his own? So we look for some guidance.  Philosophers say
that the rst thing to learn is that God exists, that he governs the
world, and that we cannot keep our actions secret, that even our
thoughts and inclinations are known to him.  The next thing to
learn about is the divine nature, because we will have to imitate the
gods if we intend to obey them and win their favour.  If the
divine nature is trustworthy, then we should be trustworthy; if it is
free, then we should be free; likewise if it is benevolent and
forgiving. All our thoughts and behaviour should be shaped on the
divine model.
 So where to begin? If you are prepared for it, I would say
that you need to begin by understanding the meaning of words.
‘Are you implying that at present I don’t?’
I am.
 ‘Then how come I use them?’
You use them the way illiterates use written signs, or the way
cattle make use of their senses; in other words, it’s possible to use
them without fully understanding what they mean.
 But if you think you really do understand, let’s take a few
words and test each other’s level of understanding.
 ‘But I’m a grown man who’s already been through the wars;
exams at my age are an imposition.’
 Don’t I know it. And after all, you’re not here because you
think you lack for anything; what could you even imagine that you
need? You’re rich, you have children, a wife probably, and a
suciency of slaves; the emperor knows you, you have many
friends in Rome, you see to your civic duties, and know how to
reward your friends and get even with your enemies.  What
more could you want? Well, what if I were to show you that all
that’s missing are the keys to happiness? That your life to date has
been devoted to everything except what it ought to be? And what if
I were to crown it o by saying that you don’t know what God is, or
man, or what good and bad are,  and – if that’s not too much to
endure – that you don’t know who you are, either? Could you put up
with me, take the criticism, and remain?  Hardly; you would be
out of here in a hu and a hurry.
And yet I won’t have done you any harm – any more than a
mirror is to blame when it shows a plain person what they look like;
or a doctor is mean if he tells a patient, ‘Look, you may think this is
insignicant, but you’re really sick; no food for you today, only
water.’ No one thinks, ‘How rude!’  But say to someone, ‘Your
desires are unhealthy, your powers of book ii aversion are weak,
your plans are incoherent, your impulses are at odds with nature
and your system of values is false and confused,’ – and o they go
alleging slander.
 Our condition can be compared to a festival.37 Cattle are
brought in to be sold, and most of the people attend to either buy or
sell; but there a few who come simply to see how and why the
festival is organized, who put it on, and for what purpose.
 It’s just the same in this festival here: some people are like
the cattle that care only for their feed; those of you focused on
wealth, property, a large household, public status – all this is
nothing more than cattle fodder.  But a few people in the crowd
are capable of reection; what is this world, they want to know, and
who runs it?  Someone must – for no country or estate can
function for any length of time without its governor or steward. And
this design, so big, so beautiful and so well planned – can it run on
its own, haphazardly?
 OK, then, there is a ruler. But who is he, and how does he
exercise control? What are we like, who are his descendants, and for
what purpose were we born? Shouldn’t there be some link between
us, some connection?
 That’s what occupies a few, who spend all their spare time
seeing and learning as much as they can about the festival before
the time comes to get up and leave.  Naturally, they are laughed
at by the majority; much the way those who make money at the
games laugh at those who are only there to watch. And I suppose if
cattle had opinions, they would make fun of anyone interested in
anything besides the grass!
II 15 To people who cling hard to certain of
their decisions
 Some people suppose that the virtue of resolution, when
considered in connection with the fact that nature made the will
free and untrammelled, and everything else blocked, checked,
slavish and external, entails that our decisions should all be
discourses honoured to the extent of never backing o from one an
inch.  No – the decision rst must be well founded. I mean, I like
a body to be strong, but strong with the energy that comes of good
health and training, not the kind that comes of some manic
disorder.  If you are taking pride in having the energy of a
lunatic, I have to say, ‘Friend, you need a therapist. This is not
strength, but a kind of inrmity.’
 In a dierent sense, this ailment aects the minds of people
who misconstrue our philosophy. A friend of mine, for instance,
arbitrarily decided that he was going to starve himself to death. 
When I heard that he was already three days into his fast, I went
and asked him to explain.
‘I made my decision,’ he said.
 ‘Yes, but what drove you to it? Look, if it is the right decision,
we are ready to sit by your side and help you make the passage.38
But if it was a reckless decision, it should be open to change.’
 ‘But we must stick with a decision.’
‘For heaven’s sake, man, that rule only applies to sound decisions.
I suppose next you will decide that it is night now, and refuse to
change your mind because you don’t want to. You will repeat, “We
must stick with a decision.”  Begin with a rm foundation;
evaluate your decision to see if it is valid – then there will be a basis
for this rigid resolve of yours.  If your foundation is rotten or
crumbling, not a thing should be built on it,∗ and the bigger and
grander you make it, the sooner it will collapse.
 ‘With no good reason, you are taking the life of an old friend
of mine, one who shares both cities with me, the big one and the
small.39  And while busy killing and doing away with an
innocent man, you keep saying, “We must stick with a decision.”
 If the idea of killing me should ever occur to you, would the
same principle apply, I wonder?’
 Well, with great diculty the man was nally prevailed on
to relent. But there are some people today whom there is just no
persuading. I have come to understand that saying which I did not
fully appreciate until now: ‘A fool cannot be convinced or even
compelled to renounce his folly.’  God save me from fools with
a little philosophy – no one is more dicult to reach.
‘I’ve made a decision.’
Yes, so have lunatics. But the more xed their delusions, the more
medication they require.  Do what sick people do, call on the
doctor and say to him, ‘Doctor, I’m sick and need your help. I
promise to follow whatever you prescribe.’  Similarly, I expect
to hear from you, ‘I am lost and don’t know what I should do. I’ve
come to you to nd out.’ Instead, I get, ‘Talk to me about anything
else; in this matter my mind’s made up.’  What else am I
supposed to talk to you about? Nothing is more important than that
I cure you of the conviction that ‘We must stick with a decision, and
never back down’ is too crude a law. This is deranged, not healthy,
resolution.
 ‘I want to die, even though I don’t have to.’∗
Why? What has happened?
‘I made that decision.’
 Good thing it wasn’t me you decided needed to go.
‘I don’t take money for my services.’
Why not?
‘That was my decision.’
Realize that this irrationality means one day you might well
switch to accepting money, and with the same degree of passion
announce, ‘This is my decision.’  You’re like someone aicted
with certain illnesses, which manifest in dierent parts of the body
at dierent times. It’s the same with the unhealthy mind; what view
it will incline to no one can ever guess. And when this arbitrariness
is reinforced by strength of purpose, the illness becomes past help or
healing.
II 16 We do not regularly put our beliefs about good and
bad into practice
 Where does the good lie?
‘In the will.’
And evil?
‘Also in the will.’
And things neither good nor bad -
‘… lie in whatever is external to the will.’
 Very good! But how many of you remember this outside class?
Do any of you, on your own, practise formulating answers to
common impressions the way you provide answers in a logical drill:
‘Is it day?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Is it night then?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then are the stars odd or
even in number?’ ‘I cannot say.’  When confronted with money,
are you trained to give the right response – ‘Money is not a good’?
Have you practised giving answers like this, or is your training
conned to sophisms?
 Well, it should come as no surprise to you that you surpass
yourself where you are trained, but get nowhere in areas you’ve
ignored.  Take the example of a public speaker. He is condent
that he has written a good speech, he has committed the thing to
memory, and can deliver it smoothly. Still he agonizes,  because
it’s not enough for him to be competent, he also hungers for the
crowd’s approval. This means that, however well trained he is in the
art of public speaking, he has no training in the business of praise
and blame.  When was he ever questioned as to what praise and
blame are, and what is the nature of each; or whether all praise
should be welcomed, and all criticism shunned? Did he ever submit
to training based on the answers to those questions?
 It’s no wonder now that, having applied himself to oratory,
he’s better than his contemporaries in that eld; but no better than
the mass of men in the areas he’s overlooked.  He is like a
musician who knows how to play, who sings well, dresses nicely –
and still experiences nerves before taking the stage. Music, he
knows; but he does not know what an audience is, or what good and
bad reviews amount to.  He doesn’t even understand his own
anxiety, whether it’s our concern or another’s, and whether it can be
managed. The result is that, if he wins applause, he returns home
full of himself; but if he is booed, he shrivels as if the air has been
let out of him and sinks down, deated.
 Our case is much the same. What do we value? Externals.
What do we look after? Externals.  So of course, we are going to
experience fear and nervousness. Faced with external circumstances
that we judge to be bad, we cannot help but be frightened and
apprehensive.  ‘Please, God,’ we say, ‘relieve me of my anxiety.’
Listen, stupid, you have hands, God gave them to you himself. You
might as well get on your knees and pray that your nose won’t run.
A better idea would be to wipe your nose and forgo the prayer. The
point is, isn’t there anything God gave you for your present
problem?  You have the gifts of courage, fortitude and
endurance. With ‘hands’ like these, do you still need somebody to
help wipe your nose?
 The trouble is, we don’t exercise these virtues because we
don’t appreciate them. Show me one person who cares how they act,
someone for whom success is less important than the manner in
which it is achieved. While out walking, who gives any thought to
the act of walking itself? Who pays attention to the process of
planning, not just the outcome?  If the plan works, of course, a
person is overjoyed and says, ‘How well we planned it! Didn’t I tell
you, with brains like ours it couldn’t possibly fail?’ But a dierent
result leaves the person devastated, incapable of even nding words
to explain what happened.
 No one ever consults a seer, or spends the night in a temple,
out of concern for the means, rather than the ends, of their actions.
Find me one such person, I want to see him. This is the person I
have looked for a long time, the true genius and aristocrat – I don’t
care if they be young or old, just nd me one.
 So how can we possibly wonder, if, having squandered our
attention on material things, we act in a way that is mean,
shameless, worthless, cowardly, meek – a complete nightmare? We
didn’t practise, or care about, that.  Rather than death or exile,
if we feared fear itself, we would practise avoiding the things we
believe to be bad.  As it is, in the classroom we’re erce and
uent, quick to answer any little question on these topics, and adept
at drawing the right conclusion. But force us to put the principles
into practice and we’re as good as lost. Let any danger loom and you
will discover what we really practised and trained for.  Then,
because of our negligence, we forever compound our problems and
make our situations out to be worse than they actually are.  So,
for instance, whenever I’m on board ship and gaze into the deep, or
look around me and see nothing but ocean, I’m gripped by terror,
imagining that if we wreck I will have to swallow all this sea. It
doesn’t occur to me that around three pints will about do me in. So
is it the sea that terries me? No, it is my imagination.  Again,
in an earthquake, I am prone to picture the whole city coming down
on top of me, whereas, in fact, a single brick is enough to dash my
brains out.
 So what oppresses and scares us? It is our own thoughts,
obviously. What overwhelms people when they are about to leave
friends, family, old haunts and their accustomed way of life?
Thoughts.  I mean, look at children: their nanny leaves them
and they begin to cry; but give them a cake and they’ve forgotten all
about their nanny.
 ‘Are you saying that we should model ourselves on children?’
No – because I don’t think you need a cake, you need correct
thoughts.
‘What are they?’
 Every day you should put the ideas in action that protect
against attachment to externals such as individual people, places or
institutions – even your own body. Remember the law of God and
keep it constantly in view:  look to your own means, leave
everything that isn’t yours alone. Make use of what material
advantages you have, don’t regret the ones you were not allowed. If
any of them are recalled, let go of them willingly, grateful for the
time you had to enjoy them – unless you want to be like a child
crying for her nurse or mother.  After all, what dierence does
it make what a person is book ii enslaved to, and cannot live
without? You’re no dierent from a teenager mooning over a girl
when you ache for your familiar haunts, your club, your old gang of
friends and former way of life.
 Here is someone distraught because he will no longer drink
of the water of Dirce.40 Is our water here in Rome inferior
somehow?
‘No, but I had grown used to Dirce’s.’
 Well, you will get used to ours in time. And once you
become used to it, the day may come when you pine for it in turn.
You may even try your hand at poetry in imitation of that line in
Euripides:
‘Ah, for Nero’s baths, and the water of Marcia!’41
Behold the birth of tragedy: when idiots come face to face with
the vicissitudes of life.
 ‘Will I ever see Athens and the Acropolis again?’
Poor fellow, you’re not satised with what you see every day?
Can you hope for any better vision than the sun, the moon, the
stars, all the land and sea?  And if you appreciate how God
governs them, and carry him around inside you, what attraction can
mere marble or ne masonry still have for you? When it is time to
leave the sun and moon behind, how will you react?  Will you
sit down and cry, like an infant? Did nothing that you heard and
studied in school get through to you? Why did you advertise
yourself as a philosopher when you might have told the truth: ‘I
made it through a couple of primers, then read a little Chrysippus –
but I hardly crossed the threshold of philosophy.’  How can you
associate yourself with Socrates, who lived and died as he did, or
with Diogenes?42  You cannot imagine either of them reduced
to tears or tantrums because they weren’t going to see this man, or
that woman, or because they had to be in Susa, say, or Ecbatana,
rather than Athens or Corinth.  Whoever can exit the party at
will when the fun begins to fade is not likely to stick around and be
bored; he will stay only as long as he is entertained -like a child
involved in playing a game.  He is hardly the kind to endure
permanent exile, or a sentence of exile until death.43  Like a
child, it’s high time you were weaned o milk and started taking
solid food – or, put another way, it’s time you stopped crying for
your nurse and mother.∗
 ‘But by leaving them I make them unhappy.’
You think you are the cause of their unhappiness? No; the cause of
their disturbance is the same as yours: judgements. Overhaul your
judgements and, if they’re smart, they will overhaul theirs.
Otherwise, their unhappiness will be of their own making.
 Listen, as the saying goes, it’s crisis time: make a last
desperate eort to gain freedom and tranquillity – to be Stoic. 
Lift up your head, like a person nally released from slavery. Dare
to face God and say, ‘From now on, use me as you like. I am of one
mind with you, I am your peer.’ † Whatever you decide, I will not
shrink from it. You may put me where you like, in any role
regardless: ocer or citizen, rich man or pauper, here or overseas.
 They are all just so many opportunities to justify your ways to
man, by showing just how little circumstances amount to.
 No, instead you keep safe indoors, waiting for mother to
come and feed you. What would Heracles have been had he just
hung around the house? He would have been Eurystheus44 – not
Heracles at all. Think about how many friends and companions
Heracles made in consequence of travelling the world. None,
however, was closer to him than Zeus, which is why he was rightly
believed to be his son. It was in obedience to him that he went
around wiping out crime and injustice.
 Well, you are no Heracles, with power to clear away the ills
of other people; no, you are not even Theseus, otherwise you might
at least relieve Attica of its troubles.45 Therefore, set your own
house in order. Cast out of your mind – not Procrustes or Sciron46 –
but sorrow, fear, lust, envy, spite, greed, petulance and overindulgence.  Getting rid of these, too, requires looking to God
for help, trusting him alone, and submitting to his direction. 
Then if you’re not willing to do this – all tears and agitation – you
will serve someone physically more powerful than you, and
continue to look outside yourself for happiness, fated never to nd
it. And that is because you look for it in the wrong place, forgetting
to look where it really lies.
II 17 How to adapt preconceptions to everyday instances
 The rst thing a pretender to philosophy must do is get rid of
their presuppositions; a person is not going to undertake to learn
anything that they think they already know.  We come to the
study of philosophy rattling o what should and should not be done,
what’s good, what’s bad, and what’s disgraceful. On this basis, we
are quite prepared to pass out praise, blame, censure, or
condemnation, subtly distinguishing good habits from bad.
 So what do we need philosophers for, if we know it all
already? We want to learn what we don’t presume to know –
namely, problems of logic. We want to learn what those
philosophers teach because it is supposed to be keen and clever.∗
 Well, it is ridiculous to imagine that you will learn anything but
what you want to learn; in other words, you can’t hope to make
progress in areas where you have made no application.
Many people, however, make the same mistake as the orator
Theopompus. He criticized Plato for wanting to dene every little
thing.47  ‘Did no one before you,’ he says, ‘use the words “good”
and “just”? Or if we did, were we ignorant of what each of them
meant – were we making empty sounds bereft of sense?’  Look,
Theopompus, no one denies that we had an inborn idea and
preconception of these terms. What we lacked was the ability to
apply them correctly. We had not yet organized them with a view to
determining the class of things each of them belongs to.
 You might as well put the same challenge to doctors: ‘Didn’t
we use the words “sick” and “healthy” before Hippocrates came
along, or were we talking nonsense?’  Well, we had a concept of
what ‘healthy’ means, yes, but even now we can’t agree on how to
adapt it. There’s one doctor who says, ‘Withhold his food,’ while
another says, ‘Make him eat.’ One says, ‘Bleed her,’ another says,
‘She needs a transfusion.’ And the cause of this chaos is none other
than our still-unrealized ability to apply the concept of ‘healthy’ to
particular cases.
 The same problem occurs in the conduct of life. ‘Good’, ‘bad’,
‘useful’, ‘harmful’ – these words are part of everyone’s vocabulary,
we all have a preconception of what they signify. But is it developed
and complete?  Prove it – apply it correctly to particular things.
Now Plato, for his part, associates denitions with his preconception
of what is ‘useful’; you, however, categorize them as useless. 
Both of you cannot be right. Some people associate the idea of the
good with wealth, or pleasure, or health; others plainly do not. 
Because if all of us who use these words are not just blowing smoke,
and we don’t need help clarifying their preconceptions, why is there
any misunderstanding, conict or blame on either side?
 But why refer to conict between dierent people, and bring
up that? Just take yourself – if you are good at applying your
preconceptions, why are you internally conicted and confused?
 We will ignore for now the second eld of study, to do with
impulse and the art of applying impulse to appropriate acts.48 Let’s
skip the third eld too, concerning assent –  I’ll give you a pass
on both. Let’s stay with the rst; it furnishes almost tangible proof
that you are not good at applying preconceptions.  If your
present desires are realistic – realistic for you personally – why are
you frustrated and unhappy? If you are not trying to escape the
inevitable, then why do you continue to meet with accident and
misfortune? Why do you get what you do not want, and don’t get
what you do?  This is categorical proof of inner confusion and
unhappiness. I want something to happen, and it fails to happen, or
I don’t want something to happen, and it does – and can any
creature be more miserable than I?
 It is just this that Medea could not tolerate, and which book
ii drove her to slay her children – a magnicent act from one point
of view, it shows she had the right idea of what it means to have
one’s desires dashed.49  ‘I’ll have my revenge on the man who
hurt and humiliated me. But what good are the usual types of
punishment? How should it happen then? I will kill my children.
But I will punish myself in the process…  Well – what of it?’
Behold the ruin of a noble soul. She did not know, in eect, that
obtaining our desire is not done by looking outside ourselves for
help, or by changing or rearranging circumstance.  Don’t want
your husband, and nothing that you want will fail to come. Don’t
want to stay with him at any price, don’t wish to stay in Corinth – in
short, don’t want anything except what God wants, and no one will
stop or stay you, any more than they can stand in the way of God.
 When you have him as your leader, and conform your will and
desire to his, what fear of failure can you have?
 Attach your desire to wealth and your aversion to poverty:
you won’t get the former, but you could well end up with the latter.
You will fare no better putting your faith in health, status, exile –
any external you care to name.  Hand your will over to Zeus
and the gods, let them administer it; in their keeping, your
happiness is assured.
 But please stop representing yourself as a philosopher, you
aected fool! You still experience envy, pity, jealousy and fear, and
hardly a day passes that you don’t whine to the gods about your life.
 Some philosopher! You learned syllogisms and changing
arguments. Good, now try unlearning them, if you can, and make a
fresh start. Wake up to the fact that so far you have barely touched
the subject.  Begin to fashion your future in such a way that
nothing happens contrary to your desire and nothing that you desire
fails to materialize.
 Give me one student with that ambition when he presents
himself at school, one committed to that kind of training, one who
says, ‘To me those other things are worthless; it’s enough if one day
I can live without sorrow and frustration, if I can lift up my head
like a free person in the face of circumstance and look to heaven as
a friend of God, without fear of anything that might happen.’ 
Show me such a person, so I can say, ‘Come, child, take what you
deserve. You were born to honour philosophy with your patronage –
these halls, these books, these lectures, they all belong to you.’ 
Then, after he’s tackled and mastered this eld of study, I will wait
until he returns and says, ‘I want to be free from fear and emotion,
but at the same time I want to be a concerned citizen and
philosopher, and attentive to my other duties, toward God, my
parents, my siblings, my country, and my guests.’  Welcome to
the second eld of study, this is yours as well.  ‘But I’ve already
mastered the second eld of study; I want to be faultless and
unshakeable, not just when I’m awake, but even when I’m sleeping,
even when I’m drunk or delirious.’50 You are a god, my child, you
are headed for the stars.
 But no, what I get instead is, ‘I want to read Chrysippus’
treatise on the Liar.’51 Is that your plan? Then go and jump in the
lake and take your ridiculous plan with you. What good could come
of it? Your unhappiness will persist the whole time you are reading
it, and your anxiety will not abate a bit during a reading of the
thing before an audience.
 Here’s how you behave: ‘Shall I read to you, brother, then
you to me?’
‘Man, it’s marvellous the way you write.’
‘Well, it’s uncanny how you capture Xenophon’s style.’
 ‘And you have caught Plato’s manner.’
‘And you Antisthenes’!’52
Then, having indulged each other in your fatuous fancies, you go
back to your former habits: your desires and aversions are as they
were, your impulses, designs and plans remain unchanged, you pray
and care for the same old things.  And so far from looking for
someone to bring you to your senses, you are distinctly oended by
any advice or correction. You say, ‘He’s nothing but a mean old
man; when I left him he showed no sign of sorrow. He didn’t say,
“My, it’s a dangerous journey you’re going on, child, I’ll light a
candle if you come through safely.”  That’s what he would say
if the man had any compassion.’ And what a blessing it would be for
a person like you to come through safely, calling for many candles
to book ii be lit! Really, you deserve to be immortal and impervious
to misfortune.
 As I said, then, this presumption that you possess knowledge
of any use has to be dropped before you approach philosophy – just
as if we were enrolling in a school of music or mathematics. 
Otherwise we won’t come close to making progress – not even if we
work our way through the collected works of Chrysippus, with those
of Antipater53 and Archedemus thrown in for good measure.
II 18 How to ght against impressions
 Every habit and faculty is formed or strengthened by the
corresponding act – walking makes you walk better, running makes
you a better runner.  If you want to be literate, read, if you want
to be a painter, paint. Go a month without reading, occupied with
something else, and you’ll see what the result is.  And if you’re
laid up a mere ten days, when you get up and try to walk any
distance you’ll nd your legs barely able to support you.  So if
you like doing something, do it regularly; if you don’t like doing
something, make a habit of doing something dierent.
 The same goes for moral inclinations. When you get angry,
you should know that you aren’t guilty of an isolated lapse, you’ve
encouraged a trend and thrown fuel on the re.  When you can’t
resist sex with someone, don’t think of it as a temporary setback;
you’ve fed your weakness and made it harder to uproot.  It is
inevitable that continuous behaviour of any one kind is going to
instil new habits and tendencies, while steadily conrming old ones.
 And as philosophers point out, this, of course, is how moral
inrmities develop also. If you are seized by greed on some
occasion, reason can be invoked to alert you to the danger. Then the
passion will abate and the mind will be restored to its former
balance.  But if you don’t bring anything by way of relief, the
mind will not return to normal; when it’s inamed by an
impression, it will yield to passion more quickly the next time. Keep
it up, and the mind grows inured to vice; eventually the love of
money is entrenched.  When someone contracts smallpox, if he
lives he is not the same as he was before the illness, unless the
recovery is complete.  It’s the same with the passions of the
soul; they leave certain scars and blisters behind. And unless you
remove them well, the next time you’re ogged on the same spot
those blisters will be open wounds.
 So if you don’t want to be cantankerous, don’t feed your
temper, or multiply incidents of anger. Suppress the rst impulse to
be angry, then begin to count the days on which you don’t get mad.
 ‘I used to be angry every day, then only every other day, then
every third…’ If you resist it a whole month, oer God a sacrice,
because the vice begins to weaken from day one, until it is wiped
out altogether.  ‘I didn’t lose my temper this day, or the next,
and not for two, then three months in succession.’ If you can say
that, you are now in excellent health, believe me.
 Today, when I saw a good-looking girl, I didn’t say to myself,
‘It would be nice to sleep with her,’ or ‘Her husband’s one lucky
guy.’ Because that’s tantamount to saying, ‘Anyone would be lucky
to sleep with her, even in adultery.’  Nor do I fantasize about
what comes next – the woman undressing in front of me, then
joining me in bed.  I pat myself on the back and say, ‘Well
done, Epictetus, you’ve solved a devilishly dicult problem, much
harder than the Master Argument itself.’54  But if the woman is
willing, if she calls to me or gives me a nod, if she takes me by the
arm, and begins to rub up against me – and still I overcome my lust
– well, that’s a test far harder than the Liar paradox, it even beats
the Quiescent.55 That’s the sort of thing to boast about – not
propounding the Master.
 So how does one get there? Start by wanting to please
yourself, for a change, and appear worthy in the eyes of God. Desire
to become pure, and, once pure, you will be at ease with yourself,
and comfortable in the company of God.  Then, as Plato said,
when a dangerous impression confronts you, go and expiate the
gods with sacrice, go to the temples to supplicate the gods for
protection.  It will even do to socialize with men of good
character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose
someone living or someone from the past.56
 Consider Socrates; look how he lay next to Alcibiades and
merely teased him about his youthful beauty.57 Think how proud he
must have been to have won that victory over himself – an Olympicsized victory, and one worthy of a successor to Heracles;58 so, really,
he’s the one who deserves to be addressed, ‘Greetings, hero’ – not
these grimy boxers and pancratiasts59 or gladiators, their current
counterparts.
 With these thoughts to defend you, you should triumph over
any impression and not be dragged away.  Don’t let the force of
the impression when rst it hits you knock you o your feet; just
say to it, ‘Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you
represent. Let me put you to the test.’ Next, don’t let it pull you in
by picturing to yourself the pleasures that await you. 
Otherwise it will lead you by the nose wherever it wants. Oppose it
with some good and honourable thought, and put the dirty one to
rout.  Practise this regularly, and you’ll see what shoulders,
what muscles, what stamina you acquire. Today people care only for
academic discussion, nothing beyond that.  But I’m presenting
to you the real athlete, namely the one training to face o against
the most formidable of impressions.
Steady now, poor man, don’t let impressions sweep you o your
feet.  It’s a great battle, and God’s work. It’s a ght for
autonomy, freedom, happiness and peace.  Remember God, ask
him to be your helper and protector, as sailors pray to the Dioscuri60
for help in a storm. Is there any storm greater than the storm of
forceful impressions that can put reason to ight? What is a real
storm except just another impression?  Put away the fear of
death, and however much thunder and lightning you have to face,
you will nd the mind capable of remaining calm and composed
regardless.
 If you lose the struggle once, but insist that next time it will
be dierent, then repeat the same routine – be sure that in the end
you will be in so sad and weakened a condition that you won’t even
realize your mistakes, you’ll begin to rationalize your misbehaviour.
 You will be living testimony to Hesiod’s verse:
‘Make a bad beginning and you’ll contend with troubles ever after.’61
II 19 To those who tackle philosophy just to be
able to talk about it
 The Master Argument62 is evidently based on the mutual
incompatibility of the following three principles: 1) everything past
that is true is necessary; 2) an impossibility cannot follow a
possibility; 3) something which is neither true nor ever will be true
is possible.
Diodorus saw the inconsistency; his solution was to concede the
truth of the rst pair of propositions, but maintain (in deance of
the third) that nothing is possible which neither is nor ever will be
true.  He was followed by someone who maintained the truth of
the other two: 3) that something is possible which neither is true
now nor ever will be, and 2) that an impossibility does not follow a
possibility – but not 1) that everything past that is true is necessary.
Cleanthes’ school, in fact, seems to have upheld the latter view, and
Antipater63 mainly agreed with him.  And some defend the other
set of principles: 3) that something is possible which neither is true
nor ever will be, and 1) everything past that is true is necessary –
but, in opposition to 2), assert that an impossibility can follow a
possibility.  To retain all three, though, is impossible because
they are mutually incompatible.
 Then, if someone asks me which of these propositions I
approve myself, I will answer him, ‘I don’t know, but I can report
that Diodorus held this opinion about them, the followers of
Panthoides, I believe, and those of Cleanthes, held that one, and the
school of Chrysippus advocated the third.’
 ‘Yes, but what about you?’
‘Look, I wasn’t born for this – to test my impressions, compare
what people say and form my own opinion on the subject.’64
Which is to say, I’m no dierent from a student of literature.
 ‘Who was Hector’s father?’
‘Priam.’
‘Who were his brothers?’
‘Alexander and Deiphobus.’
‘And who was their mother?’
‘Hecuba. Or so I’ve read.’
‘Where?’
‘In Homer. But I believe Hellanicus,65 too, has written on these
very same questions, and there may be one or two others…’
 It’s the same with me and the Master Argument; what can I
add to what’s already been said? If I am vain, however, and want to
impress people, especially at a party, I can catalogue exactly who
said what:  ‘… And Chrysippus has written splendidly on the
subject in the rst chapter of his book On Possibles. Cleanthes
devoted a whole treatise to the topic, Archedemus too. And then
there are Antipater’s contributions, not only in his book On Possibles,
but in his special monograph on the Master Argument.  Haven’t
you read it?’
‘No, I have not.’
‘Oh, read it by all means!’
And what will he gain by reading it? He’ll just be harder to shut
up than he is already. I mean, what did you gain by reading it?
What opinion did you formulate on the subject? Of course, you will
tell us all about Helen and Priam and the island of Calypso – things
which neither exist nor ever will.66
 In literature, too, it is no great achievement to memorize
what you have read while not formulating an opinion of your own.
In ethics, we do the same thing, only it’s much worse.
 ‘Tell me what’s good and bad.’
‘Listen: “The wind carrying me from Troy brought me to the
Ciconians.”67  Everything can be classied as good, bad or
indierent. The virtues, and the things that share in them, are good.
The vices and what shares in them are bad. Everything in between is
indierent, like wealth, health, life, death and poverty.’
 ‘What’s your source for that?’
‘Hellanicus says it in his book on Egypt.’
I mean, how is this any dierent from saying, ‘Diogenes68 – or
Chrysippus, or Cleanthes – says so in their Ethics’? Have you
evaluated what they have said, or made up your own mind about it?
 Let’s see how you handle a storm while on board ship. Do you
still maintain these distinctions when the sails are apping madly
and you’re crying out to heaven? Suppose some joker sidles up and
says, ‘Please be so kind as to remind me of what you were saying
the other day: A shipwreck is nothing bad – that was it, wasn’t it? –
and doesn’t have anything bad about it?’  Aren’t you inclined to
grab an oar and brain the man with it? ‘Why are you tormenting
me, pal? We’re about to die and you come along oering nothing
but jokes and ridicule?’
 If the emperor summons you to answer a charge, do you
remember these same distinctions when you show up pale and
shaking? Suppose someone comes up to you and says, ‘What are you
afraid of, friend? What signicance does this accusation have for
you? After all, it isn’t virtue or vice that Caesar hands out in his
chamber.’  ‘Why do you have to add to my troubles with your
sarcasm?’ ‘Tell me, anyway, philosopher, what are you scared of?
You’re only in danger of death, prison, torture, exile or disgrace –
that’s all. Are any of these a vice, or is there anything vicious about
them? What did you personally used to call such things?’  ‘Why
are you pestering me, pal? My own evils are enough for me.’
‘Evils’ is right: you have enough evils in the way of hypocrisy,
cowardice and the moral pretension you aected while sitting in the
classroom, dressed up in borrowed colours. Why did you used to call
yourself a Stoic?
 Just pay attention to the way you behave and you will
discover the school of philosophy you really belong to. You’ll
discover that the majority of you are Epicureans, a few
Peripatetics69 – but these grown soft.  After all, where should
we look to prove that, in actual fact, you regard virtue as equal to,
or even more important than, everything else? Show me a Stoic, if
you know of one.
 Where or how? Of course, you can produce thousands who
talk the Stoic talk; they are the same ones who are no less
conversant in Epicurean principles, and can give you an expert
account of Peripatetic doctrine too.  Well, who is a Stoic, then?
We call a statue Phidian if it is characterized by Phidias’ style. So
show me someone characterized by the beliefs that he espouses.
 Show me someone untroubled with disturbing thoughts about
illness, danger, death, exile or loss of reputation. By all the gods, I
want to see a Stoic!
 OK, you may not know of one perfectly formed; at least show
me someone in the way of becoming one – somebody pointed in the
right direction. Do me this one favour; don’t grudge an old man the
sight of something he has yet to see.  Do you plan to show us
the Zeus of Phidias, or his Athena -objects made of ivory and gold?
It’s a living soul I want one of you to show me, the soul of a person
willing to work with, and never criticize, either God or a fellow
human being. One who will never fail, or have experiences he does
not want; who will never give in to anger, jealousy or the desire to
dominate others.
But rather than try to describe him in detail  I will dene him
simply as someone set on becoming a god rather than a man. Even
in this body of death his mind is focused on communion with God.
Show me this person.  But you can’t. So stop kidding yourselves
and deceiving others about what’s most important.∗ And stop
assuming an identity that’s not your own; you’re all thieves and
robbers at large of deeds and titles that don’t in the least pertain to
you.
 Well, I am your teacher now, and you have come to me to be
educated. This is my ambition: I aspire to make you proof against
force, obstruction and disappointment; free, content and happy,
with your attention xed on God in every matter great and small.
Learning and putting these goals into practice, in the meantime, is
the reason you are here.  So why can’t you do it, if you have the
right ambition, and I, in turn, have the proper training? What’s
missing?  Whenever I see that a worker has the right material, I
expect the work to be done. Well, now, we have a workman here,
and we have the material. What are we missing?  Cannot the
thing be taught? It can. Well, then, isn’t it within our power? On the
contrary, it’s the only thing within our power. Wealth is not, nor is
health or fame – nothing, in a word, is within our power except
using impressions correctly; by nature this alone cannot be
interfered with or impeded.
 So tell me the reason why you don’t succeed. Look, either it’s
my fault, or it’s yours, or the fault lies in the nature of the thing. But
since the thing itself is manageable and alone is within our power, it
follows that either I’m at fault or you are – or, more likely, that we
both must share the blame.
 So what do you say? Are you prepared at last to get down to
business? Let’s make a fresh start. Just begin, believe me, and you
will see the truth of what I’ve been saying.
II 20 Against the Epicureans and Academics
 Even people who deny that statements can be valid or
impressions clear are obliged to make use of both. You might almost
say that nothing proves the validity of a statement more than
nding someone forced to use it while at the same time denying
that it is sound.  If, for instance, somebody were to deny that
there is anything universally true, obviously he would have to make
a statement to that eect: ‘Nothing is universally true.’ You don’t see
the contradiction?  It’s the same as if they were to say, ‘If any
truth is universal, it is false.’  Or if someone were to say to you,
‘Know this, nothing is knowable, everything is in doubt.’ Or, ‘Trust
me on this one, you’ll be glad you did: Nobody but nobody can be
trusted.’ Or, ‘You learned it here rst, my friend: There is nothing
capable of being learned.  I not only tell you this, I’ll prove it to
you if you like.’ So how – to get to the point – are these so-called
Academics any dierent? They say, ‘Believe me, everyone, nothing
can be believed with any certainty. Be certain of this: you cannot be
certain of anything.’70∗
 Epicurus is the same way. In his eort to expunge the natural
good will that men have for each other, he demonstrates the
principle that he aims to destroy.  This is what he says: ‘Don’t be
idiots, everyone, refuse to be fooled or misled: rational beings have
no natural good will toward one another, believe me. Anyone who
says dierent is trying to trick you and lead you astray.’  Well,
why do you care? Let us be tricked. After all, you won’t be any the
worse if all the rest of us are convinced that good will towards one
another does exist by nature, and that saving, not destroying, it is a
primary obligation. Actually, you’d be much better o and more
secure.
 So why, my friend, do you concern yourself with us, burning
the midnight oil and rising at dawn, to write those interminable
books? Is it because you’re worried that one of us might be misled
into thinking that the gods actually care for mankind, or mistake the
essence of the good for something besides pleasure?  Because if
that’s the case, drop everything and go to bed; make like the animal
you’ve judged yourself worthy to be: eat, drink, copulate, defecate
and snore.  The views of others on the important questions,
whether right or wrong, should hold no interest for you. What are
we to you anyway? Now, sheep, of course, you have an interest in,
inasmuch as they allow themselves to be shorn and milked and
ultimately led to slaughter.  Wouldn’t it be nice if human
beings, tranquillized and sedated by Stoic doctrine, could likewise
submit to you and your kind to be shorn and milked?  You
should have reserved your teachings for your fellow Epicureans and
kept them out of the hands of us Stoics; instead you should try and
convince us that nature intends us for fellowship, and that virtue is
a good thing, so that you can keep everything for yourself. 
Perhaps this sociability should be extended to some, but not others.
Well, who deserves it – people who reciprocate it, or people who
hold it in contempt? And no one holds it in more contempt than you
who make such a distinction.71
 What urged him to get out of bed and write the things he
wrote was, of course, the strongest element in a human being –
nature – which subjected him to her will despite his loud resistance.
 ‘Since you hold these asocial opinions,’ she told him, ‘write
them down for others to read, lose sleep in the process and by your
own behaviour belie your doctrines.’  We hear of Orestes being
hounded by the Furies, who wouldn’t let him sleep; but for Epicurus
the Furies and Avengers were much harsher. They woke him when
he slept and wouldn’t allow him a moment’s peace, forcing him to
make public his horrid views the way drunken madness goads the
priests of Cybele –  human nature is just that irresistible.72 A
vine cannot behave olively, nor an olive tree vinely – it is
impossible, inconceivable.  No more can a human being wholly
eace his native disposition; a eunuch may castrate himself but
cannot completely excise the urges that, as a man, he continues to
experience.  And so Epicurus removed everything that
characterizes a man, the head of a family, a citizen and a friend, but
he did not remove our human instincts, and could not -any more
than lazy Academics can dispose of or negate their own senses,
although most of their energy has gone into trying to do just that.
 It’s too bad, really. Nature gives a person rules and guidelines
to discover the truth, and instead of trying to complement and
improve on them, they devote themselves to impugning and
rejecting the least little thing that could assist them in the eort.
 Tell us, philosopher, what you think of piety and devotion to
the gods.
‘I will prove that it’s a good thing, if you like.’
‘Yes, prove it, so that our citizens may turn and honor the divine,
and put an end to their ambivalence about matters that are most
important.’
‘Well, are you armed with the appropriate proofs?’
‘I am, thankfully.’
 ‘Well, then, since you’re satised with them, here come the
refutations:73 The gods do not exist, and even if they exist they do
not trouble themselves about people, and we have nothing in
common with them. The piety and devotion to the gods that the
majority of people invoke is a lie devised by swindlers and con men
and, if you can believe it, by legislators, to keep criminals in line by
putting the fear of God into them.’
 Nice job, philosopher, you have rendered the citizenry a
valuable service by rescuing youth already dangerously liable to
hold the gods in contempt.
 ‘What, you mean you don’t care for those particular ideas?
Just wait: now I’ll prove that justice is nothing, that honesty is
stupidity, that being a father means nothing, that being a son means
nothing.’
 That’s good, philosopher, keep it up, and win over the young
people so that we’ll have more with the same feelings and beliefs as
you. It’s these opinions that produced our well-regulated cities.
Sparta owes its existence to such ideas. And through his laws and
system of training Lycurgus instilled his people with the following
convictions: slavery is no more bad than good, and being free is no
more good than it is bad. The fallen of Thermopylae died for these
doctrines; and what other opinions but these motivated the
Athenians to quit their city?74  And advocates of such ideas
proceed to marry, have children, become leaders in their
community, priests or prophets -of gods who don’t exist, of course.
And they consult the priest of Apollo in order to be told lies in the
form of false oracles that we then impose on others.
What a travesty!  What are you doing? You prove yourself
wrong on a daily basis and still you won’t give up these idle eorts.
When you eat, where do you bring your hand – to your mouth, or to
your eye? What do you step into when you bathe? When did you
ever mistake your saucepan for a dish, or your serving spoon for a
skewer?
 If I were slave to one of these philosophers I would taunt
him constantly, even if I got a beating every day in consequence. If
he said, ‘Put some oil in the bath, boy,’ I’d go grab the sh sauce
and pour it over his head.
‘What the… ?’
‘Pardon me, I received an impression – identical,
indistinguishable, I swear to you – of olive oil.’
‘Bring me the cereal.’
 I’d bring him a cruet full of vinegar.
‘Didn’t I ask for the cereal?’
‘Yes, sir. This is cereal.’
‘It’s not vinegar?’
‘Why vinegar any more than cereal?’
‘Well, here, smell it and taste it.’
‘How do you know if the senses don’t deceive us too?’
 Give me three or four fellow slaves in on the game, and I
would make him either renounce his way of thinking – or hang
himself in exasperation. But in fact it is they who are making fun of
us, by enjoying all the resources that nature provides while trying to
discredit them in their philosophy.  What they lack in gratitude
they make up for in gall. To cite just one example; although every
day they eat bread, they have the nerve to say, ‘We do not know if
there is a Demeter, a Persephone, or a Pluto.’75
 I hardly need add that they enjoy night as well as day, the
cycle of seasons, the stars, sea and land, and the assistance of their
fellow human beings, without giving any of them a thought; they
only want to cough up their little argument and head o to the bath
after thereby giving their stomach a workout.  Nor are they
particular about what they say, or with whom; or stop to consider
how their opinions could inuence others. I wonder what the eect
of hearing them might have on a youth who shows promise; his
potential might be completely undermined.  We could give
adulterers grounds for rationalizing their behaviour; such arguments
could provide pretexts to misappropriate state funds; a rebellious
young man could be emboldened further to rebel against his
parents. So what, according to you, is good or bad, virtuous or
vicious – this or that?  What point is there in trying to refute
one of these philosophers, arguing with them, or trying to alter their
opinion?  You’d have a better chance persuading someone to
change their sexual orientation than reaching people who have
rendered themselves so deaf and blind.
II 21 On inconsistency
 People are ready to acknowledge some of their faults, but will
admit to others only with reluctance. No one, at any rate,∗ will
admit to being stupid or obtuse. On the contrary, you hear people
on every side saying, ‘If only I had as much luck as I have sense.’ 
Shyness they will concede, saying, ‘I’m a bit timid, I know; but I’m
nobody’s fool for all that.’  Hardly anyone admits to a lack of
self-control, no one at all will admit to being unjust, few will say
that they are nosy or envious, but most will allow that they are
liable to feel pity.76
 What’s the cause of all this? Mainly it’s inconsistency and
confusion with regard to what is good and bad. But though values
dier, as a rule people will admit to practically nothing that they
regard as dishonourable.  Timidity they take to be the sign of a
sensitive nature, pity too; but stupidity they look on as the mark of a
slave. Nor are they quick to confess to selsh or asocial behaviour.
 In general, where people are led to acknowledge a fault it is
because they imagine there is something involuntary about it. So it
is with shyness and pity.  Even if they confess to a lack of selfcontrol, love is usually blamed, to gain sympathy for something
supposedly beyond our control. Injustice, on the other hand, they
don’t consider involuntary in any sense. But jealousy, in their view,
has an instinctive air about it, so they will own up to that too.
 Surrounded as we are by such people – so confused, so
ignorant of what they’re saying and of whatever faults they may or
may not have, where those faults came from and how to get rid of
them – I think we too should make a habit of asking ourselves,
‘Could it be that I’m one of them too?  What illusion about
myself do I entertain? How do I regard myself – as another wise
man, as someone with perfect self-control? Do I, too, ever make that
boast about being prepared for whatever may happen?  If I
don’t know something, am I properly aware that I don’t know it? Do
I come to a teacher as ready to submit to his instruction as if it
issued from an oracle? Or am I one of those little snots who attends
school for the sole purpose of memorizing its doctrines and
becoming familiar with books previously unknown to me, so that –
God willing – I can lecture on them to others?’
 Look, back home you and your slave have come to blows,
your whole household is in disarray, and you’re practically at war
with your neighbours. Now you come to me all dignied and
scholarly and take your seat to give a critique of my commentary on
the text, or, shall I say, of whatever nonsense came into my head to
say on that score.  You arrived full of envy and embarrassment
because you’re not getting an allowance from home and sit through
the round of lectures and discussion thinking about nothing except
how things stand between you and your father or brother: 
‘How are the people back home talking about me? Even now they
imagine that I’m making progress in my studies and are saying,
“He’ll come back knowing everything.”  Well, I guess at one
time I had hoped that I would know everything by the time I got
back – but it requires a lot of work, and I never get any help from
home, and the public baths here in Nicopolis are lthy… Things are
no better here than home.’
 So next they start saying, ‘No one is better o for attending
school.’ Yes, well, who is it that goes to school anyway? Who goes
to become a better person? Who goes prepared to have their
opinions overhauled, and to learn which ones need to be?  So
don’t be disappointed if you return home with the very same set of
ideas you arrived with. Because you had no intention of changing,
correcting or adopting others in their place.  Come, you weren’t
close to holding that intention. So at least consider this – are you
getting what you did come for? You want to be able to hold forth on
speculative topics. Well, aren’t you becoming more facile every day?
And these topics, don’t they furnish you with enough material to
make an impression in public? You’re analysing syllogisms and
changing arguments. You’re exploring the premises of the Liar
Argument, and hypotheticals. So what’s left to complain about if
you have what you’re here for?
 ‘Yes, but what good will all this do me when a child of mine
dies, or if my brother, or I myself, have to die or be tortured?’
 Nothing. Because that’s not why you came, not why you took
your seat in front of me, not the reason you sometimes sacriced
sleep to study by lamplight.
Did you ever go out into the courtyard and challenge yourself
with an external impression in place of a syllogism, and work
through it in public?  Did you ever do that? Then you say the
speculative topics are useless. Useless to whom? Only to people who
don’t use them as they should. I mean, salves and ointments are not
useless to people who apply them when and how they’re supposed
to; weights are not useless in themselves, they’re useful to some
people, worthless to others.  Now, ask me whether syllogisms
are useful, and I’ll tell you that they are, and, if you like, I’ll
demonstrate why.
‘What good have they done me?’
But you didn’t ask if they were useful to you personally, but
useful in general.  Let somebody suering from indigestion ask
me whether vinegar is useful, I will say yes.
‘So is it useful to me?’
To you, no. You need to have the discharge from your eyes
stopped rst, and your skin lesions healed. All of you, rst attend to
your wounds, stanch the bleeding, calm your mind, bring it to
school when it is free of distraction. Only then will you be in a
position to realize reason’s potential.
II 22 Of love and friendship
 Whatever you show consideration for, you are naturally inclined
to love. Nowno one, of course, shows consideration for what’s bad,
any more than they do for things that they have no connection with.
 It follows that people only show consideration for what is good.
 And if they show consideration for it, they must also love it. So
the person who knows what is good is also the person who knows
how to love. But if someone is incapable of distinguishing good
things from bad and neutral things from either – well, how could
such a person be capable of love? The power to love, then, belongs
only to the wise man.
 ‘Wait a minute,’ I hear someone say, ‘I’m no “wise man”, but I
love my child none the less.’
 First of all, I am surprised, I must say, that you would admit
to not being wise. After all, what’s missing? Your senses are in
working order, you dierentiate among impressions, and you give
your body the right food, clothing and housing.  So how is it you
say you aren’t wise?
I’ll tell you myself. It’s because you are frequently dazed or
disturbed by certain sense impressions whose appearance of truth
gets the better of you. Sometimes you think that some things are
good, then you consider the same things bad, and later you decide
that they’re indierent. In other words, you’re subject to sorrow,
fear, jealousy, anger and inconsistency. That’s the real reason you
should admit that you are not wise.
 In love and friendship you are also inconsistent, are you not? I
mean, money, pleasure and the rest you sometimes take to be good,
at other times bad. Isn’t it the same with people? Don’t you regard
the same ones as good and bad at varying times? Sometimes they’re
your friend, later your enemy; and you sing their praises only later
to run them down.
‘Yes, I admit to that too.’
 So, do you think that you can be the friend of someone if you
hold the wrong opinion about them?
‘Naturally, no.’
What if your opinion of them is subject to change∗ – can your
relations be warm?
‘No again.’
And if you alternate praise of them with disparagement?
‘No, not then either.’
 All right, no doubt you have seen dogs playing with, and
fawning before, each other, and thought, ‘Nothing could be
friendlier.’ But just throw some meat in the middle, and then you’ll
know what friendship amounts to.  Put a piece of real estate in
the centre between you and your son, and you’ll know how
impatient he is to bury you, and how even you are wishing your son
were dead. Then you say, ‘Some child I raised – he’s been planning
my funeral for years.’  Place a pretty girl in the middle, and the
old man falls for her as hard as the boy. Or dangle some honour or
another before the two of you. If you have to risk your life you’ll
repeat the words of Admetus’ father: ‘You want to see the light, don’t
you imagine your father does too?’77  Don’t you think he loved his
son when the boy was small, suered when he was sick, and could
be heard saying, ‘If only I could be sick in his place’? But, faced with
a genuine choice, they have only insults to exchange, as you see.
 Eteocles and Polyneices – didn’t they share the same mother
and father? They were reared together, lived, drank, slept together
and often exchanged an intimate kiss. Anyone seeing them would
almost certainly have mocked the philosophers with their notorious
views on friendship.78  Yet when the question came up between
them of who would be king, it was like meat thrown before a pack
of dogs. Here is what they said:
‘Where before the tower do you intend to stand?’
‘What business is that of yours?’
‘I want to be directly opposite so that I can kill you personally.’
‘And I am seized by the same desire.’79
They even petition the gods for that favour.
 It is a universal law – have no illusions – that every creature
alive is attached to nothing so much as to its own self-interest.
Whatever threatens to stand in the way of that -be it brother, father,
child or sweetheart – he will hate, curse and prosecute,  because
he is naturally disposed to favour primarily his own interest. This is
his father, his brother, his relations, his country and his god.  If
we believe the gods to be hostile to our individual interest, then we
are as ready to turn on them as on the others, knocking their statues
over and burning down their temples. Witness Alexander, who
ordered the shrines of Asclepius torched after his beloved80 died.
 The upshot is that if you identify self-interest with piety,
honesty, country, parents and friends, then they are all secure. But
separate them, and friends, family, country and morality itself all
come to nothing, outweighed by self-interest.  Wherever ‘me’
and ‘mine’ are, that’s where every creature necessarily tends. If we
locate them in the body, then the body will be the dominant force in
our lives. If it’s in our faculty of will, then that will dominate.
Likewise with externals.  But only if I identify with my will can
I be someone’s friend – or son, or father – in the true sense, because
only then will my self-interest be served by remaining loyal, honest,
patient, tolerant and supportive, and by maintaining my social
relations.  If I put myself one place, and put honour anywhere
else, the consequence will be to strengthen the view of Epicurus, as
set forth in his declaration that ‘Honour is nothing, and if it does
exist, it is only what is generally approved.’81
 Ignorance of this made the Athenians turn on the Spartans,
and the Thebans on both; made the Persian king invade Greece and
the Macedonians invade both; and now the Romans have been
induced to turn against the Getae. Going further back, it was the
cause of the Trojan War.  Paris was Menelaus’ guest, and
anyone who saw how well they treated each other would have
laughed at anyone who said they weren’t friends. But between the
two a bit of temptation was thrown in the form of a beautiful
woman, and over that there arose war.
 So now if you see friends, or brothers, who appear to be of
like mind, don’t draw any conclusions about their friendship right
away, even if they swear oaths and say that neither can live one
without the other.  A bad person’s character cannot be trusted,
it’s weak and indecisive, easily won over by dierent impressions at
dierent times.  Don’t make the common mistake of only
asking, ‘Do they share parents?’, or, ‘Did they grow up together?’,
or, ‘Did they attend the same school?’ Just ask whether they put
their self-interest in externals or in moral choice.  If it’s in
externals, you cannot call them friends, any more than you can call
them trustworthy, consistent, courageous or free. You cannot even
call them human beings, if you think about it.  Because it is no
human frame of mind that makes people snap at others and insult
them, or take to the marketplace the way bandits take to the desert
or mountains,∗ and behave like bandits in court; or that turns them
into depraved lechers and adulterers; or is responsible for all other
crimes that people commit against each other.
Their only cause is the frame of mind that sets the self and its
interests anywhere except in the realm of choice.  But if you
hear of people who are sincere in identifying virtue with choice and
the use of impressions, don’t bother with whether they are members
of the same family, or friends who’ve run together a long time;
knowing this is enough to say with condence that they are friends,
just as it’s enough to judge them fair and reliable.  For where
else is friendship found if not with fairness, reliability and respect
for virtue only?
 ‘But she has looked after me for such a long time; did she not
love me?’
‘How do you know, stupid, if she hasn’t looked after you the way
she polishes her shoes, say, or tends to her farm animals? How do
you know she won’t discard you like a broken glass once your value
as a utensil is used up?’
 ‘But she’s also my wife, and we have lived together for
years.’
‘And Eriphyle, how long was she with Amphiaraus, the mother,
too, of his many children? But a necklace came between them.82
 And by “necklace”, I mean her whole attitude toward
externals. That was the inhuman factor that destroyed their love,
and would not permit the woman to remain a wife, or the mother to
remain a mother. †  If any of you are serious about being a
friend, rid yourself of such attitudes, condemn them and drive them
out of your mind.  That way, you won’t be hard on yourself, or
be forever ghting, second-guessing and tormenting yourself. 
And then you will be in a condition to befriend others – forming
easy and natural relationships with like-minded people, but capable
too of treating unenlightened souls with sympathy and indulgence,
remembering that they are ignorant or mistaken about what’s most
important. Never be harsh, remember Plato’s dictum: ‘Every soul is
deprived of the truth against its will.’83
 If you don’t get rid of these attitudes, however, you may do
all the things friends typically do together, like drink, board, and
travel, you can even have the same ancestry – but so can snakes.
They can never be friends, though, and neither can you, as long as
you hold on to these hateful and inhuman judgements.
II 23 On the art of expression
 Everyone would read with greater ease and pleasure a book
written in a legible hand. And so it is with a speech: everyone would
listen with greater ease to one composed in well-wrought and wellorganized prose.  So we must not say that there is no such thing
as a faculty of expression. That would mark us out as lazy as well as
ungrateful – ungrateful, because it scorns God’s gifts, just the same
as if one were to deny the value of the power of sight, of hearing, or
of speech itself.
 Was it for nothing that God gave you eyes and endowed them
with breath so keen and rened that it spans the distance to objects,
and assumes their shape?84  Do you know of any messenger
that’s as fast or accurate? And was it for nothing that he made the
air between responsive and elastic enough to permit vision to pass
through it? And what of light, without which the rest would be
useless – was it for nothing that he created that too?
 So don’t be ungrateful for these gifts, but at the same time
don’t forget that there are others superior to them. Give thanks to
God for sight, for hearing, for life itself and the means provided to
support it, like grain, wine and oil.  But remember that he has
given you something superior to all these, the faculty intended to
use them, to test them, and to judge their relative worth.  After
all, what is it that determines in the case of each of these faculties
what value to assign them? You’ve never heard sight speak up for
itself, or hearing∗; both have been appointed to be slaves and
subordinates to the faculty of using impressions.  What other
faculty do you consult to learn what each thing is worth? What
faculty can be superior to this one, which employs the others in a
subordinate capacity, testing and passing judgement on each? 
None of the others knows what it is or what it is worth, when it
should or should not be used. What faculty is responsible for
opening and closing the eyes, depending on whether or not it judges
a thing worthy of being seen? Sight itself? No, it is the will. What
opens or stops our ears,  making us either receptive to a speech
or unmoved by it? Not hearing; it is the will and the will alone.
 Well now; the will looks around and nds itself in the
company of faculties that are deaf and blind, incapable of looking
after anything except the business that they were appointed to care
for under will’s own direction. Only the will is discerning enough to
look after them, in proportion to their value, and supervise itself at
the same time. Realizing this, is the will likely to declare anything
other than itself supreme? An eye, when open, has no option but to
see.  The decision whether to look at a particular man’s wife,
however, and how, belongs to the will.  And the determination
whether to trust what someone says, and then, if we trust them,
whether we should be angered by it – that also belongs to the will.
 This faculty of expression and arranging words – if it really is
a faculty – does nothing more than dress up and organize words on
a given topic, the way a hairdresser arranges hair.  But whether
to speak at all or remain silent, and then, if the former, whether it is
better to speak this way or that, and if this is or is not appropriate –
in short, determining the right time and utility for every speech – all
these are the province of the will. So don’t expect it to come
forward and vote for anything but itself.
 ‘But what if all this is true, and the subordinate element can
still be superior to what it serves, as, for instance, the horse to the
rider, the dog to the hunter, the instrument to the musician, or a
subject to his king?’ Look, what puts the other faculties to use? The
will. What administers all of them?  Then, what destroys the
person as a whole, sometimes by hunger, sometimes by hanging,
sometimes by jumping o a cli? The will.  Is there anything in
the human sphere, then, that takes precedence? How can anything
subject to obstruction be stronger than something that is not? 
Now both the will and externals are tted by nature to obstruct the
power of sight, as well as speech and hearing. But what can obstruct
the will? Nothing external; only the will can turn back on, and
obstruct, itself. Which is why virtue and vice apply to it and it
alone.
 Now let’s see so great a faculty, the one put in charge of all
the rest, come forward and say that the esh is the element that
rules over everything. Such a claim to prominence would be
intolerable even from the esh itself.  Come, Epicurus, which
part of you was it that was responsible for making such a
pronouncement? Which part authored works on The End, on Physics,
and on The Criterion of Truth? Which part let your beard grow long?
85 Or described yourself, at the hour of death, ‘as passing a most
happy day, which also happens to be our last’?  Was it esh – or
the will? Only madness could get you to acknowledge any faculty of
greater authority than the will. Or are you really that deaf and
blind?
 Does this mean that our other faculties should be despised?
Of course not. We certainly do not say that there is nothing to be
used or gained apart from the will; that is stupid, besides being
impious and ungrateful to God. Each thing must be given its due.
 Even a donkey has some utility, only not as much as an ox.
There is some use in a dog, but not as much as in a slave. There is
use in slaves, but not so much as in free citizens. There is use in
them, too, but not so much as in the people who rule over them.
 If some things are of greater value, however, that does not
mean we should slight the contribution of the others. The faculty of
expression has its utility, even if it is less than the power of the will.
 So let no one suppose that, in saying this, I am suggesting that
you should be careless of how you express yourself, any more than
you should neglect your eyes, ears, hands, feet, clothes or shoes.
 But if I’m asked to name the greatest element of all, what am I
to say? The faculty of speech? I cannot. It is the faculty of the will,
when rightly applied,  since it controls speech as well as every
other faculty, great and small. It is by putting this right that a good
person becomes good; when its purpose fails, he turns bad.  It
determines whether we are to know happiness or not, and whether
we will be on hostile or amicable terms with our neighbours. Simply
put – ignore it and unhappiness results, give it your attention and
your happiness is assured.  Yet to try to eace the faculty of
eloquence and say that there is no such thing, this really betrays a
kind of cowardice, besides ingratitude toward those who have given
it.  It seems to me that someone with such an attitude is afraid
that, if a faculty of expression does exist, we won’t be able to ignore
it.  It’s like people who pretend that there is no dierence
between ugliness and beauty. Seeing Thersites, then, aected people
the same as seeing Achilles; and Helen made no greater impression
than the sight of the average woman?  That, too, is an ignorant
and boorish attitude, characteristic of people with no power of
discernment; they’re afraid that if they begin to notice the
dierence, right away they’ll lose control and fall under the sway of
beauty altogether.  The important thing is this: allow everyone
their particular gift or talent, but step back and look at what it’s
worth. Then come to recognition of the faculty that rules them.
Make that the object of your avid pursuit and relegate the others to
a secondary role, while still giving them what attention you can
spare.  Take the eyes: they demand attention, but not because
they are of primary importance, but for the sake of what actually is;
because the ruling faculty cannot function as nature intended it
unless it makes judicious use of the eyes, in making choice among
particulars.
 But here’s what happens: people act like a traveller headed
for home who stops at an inn and, nding it comfortable, decides to
remain there.  You’ve lost sight of your goal, man. You were
supposed to drive through the inn, not park there.
‘But it’s nice here.’
Look, there are plenty of nice inns in addition to that one, plenty
of nice resorts∗ –  but they are only way stations. Your goal was
dierent: to return to your native community, help insure the safety
of the citizenry, then turn your attention to acting the part of a
citizen yourself.86 Get married, raise children, and be prepared to
hold the usual public oces.  You see, you didn’t come with the
option of choosing one of those pleasanter places; you are meant to
live and go about your business in the place where you were born
and made citizen.
Well, something analogous goes on in our school here.  Since
you can’t make progress towards your ideal without the benet of
teaching based on the spoken word, and since the same goes for
purifying the will and correcting the power of using impressions;
and since communicating our principal doctrines requires the use of
careful diction, and a certain variety and forcefulness of style, 
some students become captivated by all these things and don’t want
to proceed further. One is captivated by diction, another by
deductive or equivocal arguments, someone else by yet another ‘inn’
of this kind; and there they stay and rot as if seduced by the Sirens.
 Your objective, my friend, was to see to it that you make
natural use of whatever impressions come your way; that you do not
fail in your desires, or have experiences you don’t want; that you
never be unfortunate or unhappy, but free, unrestricted and
unrestrained; in sympathy with God’s rule, which you submit to
cheerfully; at odds with no one, no one’s accuser; able in all
sincerity to speak Cleanthes’ line:
‘Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny.’
87
 But though this is the goal you’re given, next thing you know a
turn of phrase catches your fancy, or certain abstract propositions,
and there you call halt and decide to pitch camp. You’ve forgotten
all about your obligations back home, announcing, ‘It’s pleasant
here.’ Well, who says otherwise? But pleasant as a way station, as an
inn.  What’s to keep you from speaking like Demosthenes88 and
still being unhappy? Or analysing arguments like Chrysippus while
still uneasy, still subject to envy and irritation – still distressed and
downhearted, in other words? Nothing.  So, you see, those inns
were not without value,∗ but your goal lay elsewhere.
 When I say this to some people, they imagine that I am
denouncing rhetoric, or care in the presentation of principles. But
I’m not one of those who denounce it, only the obsessive devotion to
it, and making it the focus of one’s hopes and expectations.  If
someone who advocates this view does his listeners a disservice,
then set me down as one of the oenders. When I see that one thing
is supreme and most important, I cannot say that something else is,
just to make you happy.
BOOK III
III 3 What is the material proper to the good person and
what is the goal they should strive to achieve
 The body is the raw material of the doctor and physical
therapist. Land is the farmer’s raw material. The raw material of the
good man is his mind – his goal being to respond to impressions the
way nature intended.  As a general rule, nature designed the
mind to assent to what is true, dissent from what is false and
suspend judgement in doubtful cases. Similarly, it conditioned the
mind to desire what is good, to reject what is bad and to regard
with indierence what is neither one nor the other.  Just as it is
not in the power of a banker or retailer to reject Caesar’s money –
they are forced to make a proportional exchange whether they want
to or not – so it is with the soul:  when presented with something
good it gravitates toward it immediately, as it recoils from anything
bad. The soul will never reject a clear impression of good, any more
than Caesar’s coin can be refused. The actions of gods as well as
men are entirely based on this principle.
 It follows that the good is preferred over every human
association. I care nothing for my father – only for the good.
‘Are you that unfeeling?’
I am that way designed; it is the currency God gave me.  The
upshot is that, if the good turns out to be something other than
decency and fairness, then father, brother, country and the rest can
all go hang.  Now look, am I supposed to step aside and abandon
my good just so you can have yours? Why?
‘Because I’m your father.’
But not the good.
‘I’m your brother.’
But not the good.
 If, however, we locate the good in soundness of character,
then it becomes good to maintain these relationships. Whoever gives
up some material things also wins the good.
 ‘My father is laying waste to my inheritance.’
But not harming you.
‘My brother will claim more than his share.’
He’s welcome to as much as he likes. Will he take a greater share
of honesty, loyalty and brotherly love?  No; even Zeus cannot
deprive you of that fortune – because he chose not to be able to. He
entrusted it to me and gave me a share equal to his own – free, clear
and unencumbered.
 If people have a dierent currency, just ash it, and
whatever is for sale there will be yours in exchange.  A corrupt
governor has come to power in our province. What currency does he
recognize? Silver. Show him silver, then, and you can cart o what
you like. Here is an adulterer. His currency takes the form of pretty
girls. ‘Take the money, and sell me the merchandise.’ In this way
they are bought and sold.  Here is one whose taste runs to boys.
Procure him his currency and you can take what you please.
Another is devoted to the hunt. Oer him some handsome horse or
dog, and he will groan and complain, but in the end sell o
whatever he has in order to make your price. You see, another from
within1
forces him to act like this, ever since he designated this his
currency.
 Here is the primary means of training yourself: as soon as
you leave in the morning, subject whatever you see or hear to close
study. Then formulate answers as if they were posing questions.
Today what did you see – some beautiful woman or handsome man?
Test them by your rule – does their beauty have any bearing on your
character? If not, forget them. What else did you see?  Someone
in mourning for the death of a child? Apply your rule. Death too is
indierent, so dismiss it from your mind. A consul crossed your
path; apply your rule. What category of thing is a consulship – a
good of the mind or one of matter? If it’s the latter, then out with it,
it failed our test. If it is nothing to you, reject it.
 Now, if we continued to practise this discipline every day
from morning to night, we would see some results, by God.  As
it is, though, we are overcome by every impression that we meet.
Only in school – if even there – does our brain briey come to life.
Outside school, whenever we see a person in mourning, we think to
ourselves, ‘She’s crushed.’ If we happen to spy a consul, we think,
‘There goes one lucky man.’ The sight of a person in exile elicits
‘How tragic’ in response; a beggar prompts us to think, ‘Poor guy, he
doesn’t even have money enough for food.’  These are the
insidious opinions we need to concentrate hard to expunge. What,
after all, are sighing and crying, except opinions? What is
‘misfortune’? An opinion. And sectarian strife, dissension, blame and
accusation, ranting and raving –  they all are mere opinion, the
opinion that good and bad lie outside us. Let someone transfer these
opinions to the workings of the will, and I personally guarantee his
peace of mind, no matter what his outward circumstances are like.
 The soul is like a bowl of water, with the soul’s impressions
like the rays of light that strike the water.  Now, if the water is
disturbed, the light appears to be disturbed together with it –
though of course it is not.  So when someone loses
consciousness, it is not the person’s knowledge and virtues that are
impaired, it is the breath2
that contains them. Once the breath
returns to normal, knowledge and the virtues are restored to normal
also.3
III 4 To someone who became a little too excited
in the theatre
 When the governor of Epirus was too demonstrative for some in
his support of a certain comic actor in the theatre, he came to
Epictetus to share with him how peeved he was with his detractors.
Well, said Epictetus, what fault did they commit? They were only
showing their enthusiasm the same way you did.
[2‘Andthisishow theydemonstratetheir loyalties?’heasked.
Yes, Epictetus said; when they saw you, their governor, the friend
and ocial of Caesar, making a agrant display of partiality,
naturally they were inclined to take sides too.  If it isn’t right to
cheer so loud, stop doing it yourself; but if it is allowable, why be
upset if you nd them imitating you? Who, after all, should the
masses imitate, if not you, their superior? Who else are they going
to x their eyes on?  ‘Look how the procurator of Caesar
behaves,’ they say. ‘He’s shouting; in that case I’ll shout too. He’s
leaping out of his seat; I think I’ll leap out of mine. His claque of
slaves is shouting from every corner of the arena; I don’t have
slaves, but I’ll make up for it by yelling louder than all of them.’
 You have to realize that, when you go to the theatre, you
serve as a model and standard of conduct for the rest of the crowd.
 The question, then, is why they should have faulted you. It’s
because everyone hates the thing that stands in their way. They
wanted one actor crowned, you wanted a dierent one: they stood
in your way and you in theirs. They saw you win owing to your
inuence. So they did the only thing left for them to do, they ranted
against the thing that stood in their way.  Don’t expect to get
your wish and not get an earful concerning what they wished had
happened.
The way they carry on should come as no surprise. I mean, don’t
farmers and sailors rage against Zeus when he stands in their way?
The emperor is railed against constantly. And don’t think the two of
them are unaware of it.  Caesar’s spies report back to him
whatever they overhear. And what is his response? He knows that if
he punished every person who ever said something bad about him,
he would have no one left to rule.  As far as you’re concerned,
when you attend the theatre, don’t say, ‘Come on, Sophron, win the
crown!’ Instead, say, ‘I pray that my will remains in tune with
nature here; because no actor means more to me than I do to myself.
 It’s absurd that I should lose, just so that someone else can win
a prize for comic acting.’
 ‘So who should I hope wins? The winner. That way the
victory is always exactly what I hoped for.’
‘But I want Sophron to be crowned.’
Then hold all the contests you want at your own house, and you
can proclaim him victor in the Nemean, Pythian, Isthmian and
Olympic Games conjointly.4
 But out in public don’t ask for too much
by hoping to gain a monopoly on a privilege shared by all – 
otherwise get used to being vilied. Because when you engage in
the same things as the masses, you lower yourself to their level.
III 5 To students who leave school for reasons
of ill health
 ‘I am ill here,’ said a student, ‘and want to go home.’
 Because you were never ill at home, I suppose? Consider
whether you are doing anything here to improve your will. Because
if you aren’t achieving anything, you arrived for no good reason to
begin with.  Leave, attend to your aairs at home; if your
governing principle cannot be brought into line with nature, maybe
your patch of land can, at least. You will add to your savings, look
after your ageing father, frequent the law-courts, serve as a
magistrate, and do whatever comes next – you sorry creature, in
your sad and sorry way.
 But if you understand that you are getting rid of bad
judgements and gaining others in their place, that you have
transferred your attention from things outside control of the will to
things within, and that now if you cry ‘Poor me!’ it is not for your
father or your brother’s sake but your own, then why should
sickness concern you any more?  You must realize that death and
illness are bound to overtake us whatever it is we’re doing. They
overtake the farmer at the plough, the sailor at the helm;  what
do you want to be doing when they come upon you? Because you
have to be doing something when you go; and if you can nd
anything better than this to be doing, then do it by all means.
 Speaking for myself, I hope death overtakes me when I’m
occupied solely with the care of my character, in an eort to make it
passionless, free, unrestricted and unrestrained.  That’s how I’d
like to be engaged, because then I can sayto God, Is there any way I
violated your commands? Or misapplied the gifts I received from
you? Orused my senses and preconceptions unproductively? Did I
ever blame you? Did I ever nd fault with your administration? 
I fell sick when you wanted it: so did others, but I did not complain.
I became poor when you wanted, again without complaint. I did not
hold oce, because you did not want it; and never desired to hold
oce. Did you ever nd me angry for that reason? Did you ever see
me any way but with a smile on my face, ready to obey any orders
that you had for me?  Now you want me to leave the fair, so I
go, feeling nothing but gratitude for having been allowed to share
with you in the celebration, to get to see your works and
comprehend your rule.
 Let these be my thoughts, these my studies, whether writing
or reading, when death overtakes me.
 ‘But my mother won’t be here to hold my head while I am
ill.’
Well then go to your mother. You deserve, in fact, to be held by
her whenever you’re ill.
 ‘But I had a nice little bed to lie on at home.’
Go to your nice bed, then; sick or well you deserve to lie on a bed
like that. Please don’t miss out on whatever you can do there on my
account.
 What does Socrates say? ‘One person likes tending to his
farm, another to his horse; I like to daily monitor my selfimprovement.’5
 ‘In what? Little phrases?’
Hush.
‘Clever theories, then?’
Don’t be absurd.
 ‘Well, as far as I can see, philosophers don’t busy themselves
with anything but.’
It’s no small thing – can we agree? – never to accuse anyone, God
or man, never to blame anyone, and to have the same countenance
going in or out.  These are the things that Socrates knew, and
yet he never said that he knew or taught anything; and if anyone
came looking for phrases or theories he would escort them to either
Protagoras or Hippias.6 He would have escorted someone looking
for vegetables to a greengrocer in exactly the same way. Which of
you has the same attitude?  If you did, you would gladly put up
with illness, hunger and death.  Any of you who have been in
love with some girl or other knows I speak the truth.
III 8 Why training for impressions is necessary
 Just as we practise answering sophistic questions, so should
we train for impressions every day,  as they implicitly pose their
own questions.
‘So-and-so’s son died.’ (‘The question’).
Answer: ‘Since it’s nothing he can control, it isn’t bad.’
‘So and so’s father left his son nothing when he died.’
‘Not something the son can control, so not bad.’
‘Caesar condemned him.’
‘Outside his control – not bad.’
 ‘He lamented these events.’
‘That is in his control – and bad.’
‘He withstood it like a man.’
‘That is in his control – and good.’
 If we make a habit of such analysis, we will make progress,
because we will never assent to anything unless it involves a
cognitive impression.7
 ‘His son died.’
What happened? His son died.
‘Nothing else?’
Nothing.
‘The ship was lost.’
What happened? The ship was lost.
‘He was thrown into jail.’
What happened? He was thrown into jail. ‘He’s in a bad situation’
is a stock comment that everyone adds on their own account.
 ‘But it’s not right of Zeus to do this.’
Why? Because he made you tough and proud, removed the stigma
of evil from these circumstances and made it possible for you to be
happy despite them? Or because he left the door open when things
nally don’t agree with you? Friend, take advantage of it, and stop
blaming God.
 If you care to know what the Romans think of philosophers,
just listen. Italicus, who was reputed to be one of their nest
philosophers, was angry with his friends once when I happened to
be by. ‘I can’t stand it any more,’ he said, as though he were in
extremis, ‘you’re killing me. You want me to end up’ – and here he
pointed in my direction – ‘like him!’8
III 16 That one should be careful about entering into social
relations
 It is inevitable if you enter into relations with people on a
regular basis, either for conversation, dining or simple friendship,
that you will grow to be like them, unless you can get them to
emulate you.  Place an extinguished piece of coal next to a live
one, and either it will cause the other one to die out, or the live one
will make the other reignite.  Since a lot is at stake, you should
be careful about fraternizing with non-philosophers in these
contexts; remember that if you consort with someone covered in dirt
you can hardly avoid getting a little grimy yourself.
 I mean, what are you going to do if your friend starts
nattering about gladiators, horses and sports stars; or, even worse, if
he starts gossiping about shared acquaintances: ‘He’s good, she’s
bad, it’s good this happened, it’s too bad about that…’? What if he
sneers, ridicules and even plays low-down tricks?  Do any of you
have the musician’s ability to pick up an instrument, immediately
identify which strings need attention, and bring the whole
instrument into tune? Or Socrates’ gift in every setting of winning
over the company to his side? Not likely.  Inevitably you are
going to adopt the common person’s mentality instead.
 So why are they stronger than you? Because they talk such
garbage from conviction, whereas your ne talk is no more than lip
service. It lacks life and vigour; anyone listening to your speeches
might well come to hate that damned ‘virtue’ you keep proclaiming.
 That’s why those fools get the better of you. Conviction is quite a
potent and irresistible force.  So until those ne principles take
root in you so that you can begin to rely on them a little, I advise
you to use discretion in associating with such people. Otherwise
whatever you write down in class will melt away like wax in the
sun.  Keep well out of the sun, then, so long as your principles
are as pliant as wax.
 This is why philosophers say that we should even leave our
native land, since old habits pull us back and make it hard to
embark on a new routine; also, we can’t stand running into people
who say, ‘Look at him, this so-and-so, trying to become a
philosopher.’  Similarly, doctors, for good reason, send their
most chronic patients away to a dierent environment and a
dierent climate.  Adopt new habits yourself: consolidate your
principles by putting them into practice.
 No. Instead from school it’s straight o to the theatre, to a
gladiatorial game, to an athletic show or the circus. Then from there
you come back here, and from here, o you go again, the same
people, the same pursuits –  you show no serious discipline,
concern, or care for yourself. ‘How do I handle chance impressions,
naturally or unnaturally? Do I respond to them as I should, or don’t
I?∗ Do I tell externals that they are nothing to me?’  Unless this
describes you, forsake your old habits, and your non-philosophical
friends, if you hope to amount to anything.
III 20 Every circumstance represents an opportunity
 Just about everyone agrees that ‘good’ or ‘bad’ in the case of
objective judgements applies to us, not to things outside us.  No
one calls ‘good’ the fact that it is day, or ‘bad’ that it is night, or ‘the
greatest of evils’ that three is equal to four.  No, they call correct
judgement good and incorrect judgement bad – the consequence
being that good even comes of error, when we recognize the error as
such.
 And so it should be in life. ‘Being healthy is good, being sick is
bad.’ No, my friend: enjoying health in the right way is good;
making bad use of your health is bad. ‘So even illness can benet
us?’  Why not, if even death and disability can? It was no small
advantage Menoeceus derived from his dying, after all.9
‘Whoever
says so is welcome to the same advantages!’ Come, by his sacrice
didn’t he save himself – that is, the patriot in him, the benefactor,
the man of honour, the man of his word – all of whom would have
died had he survived?  Conversely, he would have acquired the
reputation for being timid, mean, treacherous and weak.
Well – do you think his death did him hardly any good?  I
suppose the father of Admetus10 greatly enjoyed living on such base
and despicable terms,  who afterward died all the same. For
God’s sake, stop honouring externals, quit turning yourself into the
tool of mere matter, or of people who can supply you or deny you
those material things.  So is it possible to benet from these
circumstances? Yes, from every circumstance, even abuse and
slander. A boxer derives the greatest advantage from his sparring
partner – and my accuser is my sparring partner. He trains me in
patience, civility and even temper.  I mean, a doctor who puts
me in a headlock and sets a dislocated pelvis or shoulder – he
benets me, however painful the procedure. So too does a trainer
when he commands me to ‘lift the weight with both your hands’ –
and the heavier it is, the greater the benet to me.
Well, if someone trains me to be even-tempered, am I not
beneted in that case?  This shows you do not know how to be
helped by your fellow man. I have a bad neighbour – bad, that is,
for himself. For me, though, he is good: he exercises my powers of
fairness and sociability. A bad father, likewise, is bad for himself,
but for me represents a blessing.  The wand of Hermes promises
that ‘whatever you touch will turn to gold’. For my part, I can say,
‘bring what challenge you please and I will turn it to good account:
bring illness, death, poverty, slander, a judgement of death: they
will all be converted to advantage by my wand of Hermes.’
 ‘What good will you get from death?’
‘I will make it your glory, or the occasion for you to show how a
person obeys the will of nature.’
 ‘What will you make of illness?’
‘I will expose its true nature by outdoing myself in calmness and
serenity; I will neither beg the doctor’s help, nor pray for death.
 What more could you ask? Everything, you see, that you throw
at me I will transform into a blessing, a boon -something dignied,
even enviable.’
 But no. Instead, you say, ‘Be careful that you don’t get ill: it’s
bad.’ Which is like saying, ‘Guard against ever entertaining the idea
that three is equivalent to four: it’s bad.’ How is it bad? If I weigh
the statement correctly, what harm can it do me? It is more likely to
help.  Similarly, it is enough if I hold the right idea about
poverty, illness and removal from oce: all such challenges will
only serve my turn. No more, then, should I look for bad, and good,
in external conditions.
 Ah, but these principles never leave the school, no one takes
them with him when he goes back home. Instead, war immediately
breaks out – with your slave, your neighbours, with people who
sco at these principles and make fun of you.  For my part, I
bless Lesbios for daily reminding me that I know nothing.11
III 22 On Cynicism12
 An acquaintance, evidently attracted to Cynicism, wanted to
know who was qualied to be a Cynic and what one could expect
from it.
‘We will consider the topic at length,’ Epictetus said.  But this
much I can tell you already: whoever undertakes the project without
God’s approval is inviting God’s anger and will only make a public
spectacle of himself.  I mean, in a well-run household you don’t
nd just anybody presuming to think, ‘I should be running the
place.’ Otherwise the owner, when he turns around and sees
someone insolently giving orders, will haul him outside and have
him whipped.  It’s no dierent in the community of God and
men: here too there is a master who assigns everything its place. 
‘You are the sun. You are empowered as you move to make the year
and the seasons, cause plants to grow and ourish, rouse the winds
or calm them, and keep men’s bodies suciently warm. Go, revolve,
put everything, great and small, into motion.
 ‘You are a cow. When a lion appears you know what to do, or
you won’t even survive to regret it. You are a bull: step out and face
the lion, it’s your job. It suits you and you have what it takes.
 ‘You can lead the army to Troy: be Agamemnon. You can take
on Hector in single combat: be Achilles.’  If Thersites had
presumed to ask for command, either he would have been turned
down at, or he would have made an ass of himself in front of
hundreds of witnesses.
 You need to consider the present business carefully because it
isn’t what you think.
 ‘Already I wear a tattered coat like the Cynic’s, and I already
sleep on the ground, just as I will when I go Cynic. I have but to add
a satchel and a sta to become an itinerant beggar who hectors
everyone crossing his path. If I see a man who shaves his body hair,
I’ll be sure to lay into him, just like someone elaborately coied, or
seen strutting around in nery.’ 
If that’s how you picture Cynicism, it’s better that you keep your
distance. In fact, don’t go anywhere near it, the position is not for
you.
 If you picture it realistically, however, and don’t think
yourself unworthy, consider next the project’s scale.  To begin
with, you have to set a dierent example with your behaviour. No
more blaming God or man. Suspend desire completely, train
aversion only on things under your control. Banish anger, rage,
jealousy and pity. Be indierent to women, fame, boys and tempting
foods.  Other people indulge in these things protected by walls
or the gloom of night. They have many ways of hiding; they can
lock the gate and station someone outside their chamber: ‘If anyone
comes, tell them, “The master’s out,” or, “He’s occupied.” ’
 The Cynic, in contrast, only has his honour to protect him.
Without it he will be exposed to shame – naked, and out of doors.
Honour is his house, his gate, his guards, his cloak of darkness. 
He must not have anything personal he wants to hide; otherwise, so
long – he has killed the Cynic, the free spirit, the man of the open
air. He has begun to fear factors outside his control and crave
concealment – which he cannot have even if he tries, because he has
no place or means to hide.  If this teacher and trainer at large
has the bad fortune to fail, what mortication must he feel! 
With all this weighing on his conscience, how is he going to nd the
complete condence he needs to give other people advice? There’s
no way, it just is not possible.
 To begin with, then, you must purify your intellect by
training your thoughts:  ‘My mind represents for me my
medium – like wood to a carpenter, or leather to a shoemaker. The
goal in my case is the correct use of impressions.  The body is
irrelevant to me, as are its members. Death, too, whether of the
whole body or a part, can come when it likes.  And exile?
Where can they send me? Nowhere outside the world, since
wherever I end up, the sun will be there, as will the moon and stars.
There will still be dreams, birds of augury, and other means of
staying in touch with the gods.’
 Disciplining the mind, though, is just the start of the true
Cynic’s duty. He has to realize that he has been sent by God as a
messenger for the benet of others, by bringing them to an
awareness of how confused they are about what is good and bad,
and how this causes them to look for the good in vain, having no
clue as to its true location. The Cynic should realize that in addition
to being a messenger he is also a spy.13  He needs to be like
Diogenes, when he was captured in the battle of Chaeronea, and
dragged before Philip.14  The Cynic is a bona de spy; he
reports back on who is friend or foe. He must check and doublecheck before he returns with the truth, to guard against fear and
false reports.
 He should be prepared, if necessary, to mount the podium
and, like Socrates, say, ‘Where are you going, you poor souls, and
what are you doing? You drift about as if you were blind. You
forsake the right road for a cul-de-sac. You look for peace and
happiness in the wrong places; and you’re suspicious of anyone who
tries to point you in the right direction.’  Don’t look for it in
externals; it isn’t in the body, and, if you doubt me, just look at
Myron or Ophellius. It isn’t in wealth, look at Croesus, or look at the
rich of today: you’ll see how unhappy they are. It doesn’t lie in
oce, otherwise those who have been consuls multiple times would
be happy – which they are not.15  Whom are we going to trust
on this score – you, who see only the surface and are dazzled by
wealth and power – or these people personally? What do they tell
us?  Just hear them groan and complain; they say their lives are
worse and less safe for having been consul more than once, thereby
attracting fame and notoriety.  Being king is not the answer
either; otherwise it would have made Nero and Sardanapalus16
happy. Even Agamemnon, a better ruler than either of them, was
not therefore happy. When his men were still snoring away, what
was he doing?
He pulled many a hair from his head, roots and all.
What did he say?
I pace up and down… My spirit is troubled, and my heart is pounding
right out of my chest.17
 Poor man, what’s worrying you? It can’t be money, You are
rich in gold and bronze.
18 Nor can it be your health, you’re ne. Your
problem is that you have neglected and ruined the faculty with
which we exercise the will to get or to avoid, to act or not to act.
How?  By not learning the true nature of the good to which it is
born and of the nature of evil, or learning where its interest lies.
Whenever something that is none of its interest goes awry, it thinks,
‘Poor me, the Greeks are under attack.’
 ‘Too bad for your mind, rather – the one thing you have
neglected from indierence.’
‘They are going to die at the Trojans’ hands.’
‘And if they are not killed by the Trojans, won’t they die
regardless?’
‘Yes, but not all at once.’
‘What dierence does that make? If death is wrong, then it is
wrong whether they go singly or together. And after all, death
signies nothing more than the separation of body and soul. 
And if the Greeks die, do they close the door behind them? Isn’t
death in your power too?’
‘It is.’
‘So why complain, “Alas, to be king and have to carry Zeus’
sceptre”? A king can no more be unfortunate than God. So what
does that make you?  Right, a shepherd – that is how you react,
anyway, like a shepherd whining when a wolf snatches one of his
sheep. And your subjects too – alas, they are sheep for real.
 ‘Why did you come? Your desire was not in danger, was it,
or your choice, impulse or aversion?’
‘No, Paris ran o with my brother’s wife.’
 ‘Wasn’t that a blessing in disguise, to rid your brother of his
little wench of a wife?’
‘Well, should we just let the Trojans insult us?’
‘Are the Trojans wise or foolish? If they are wise, do not quarrel
with them; if they are fools, ignore them.’
 ‘If it’s not in any of these things I’ve been protecting, then
where is the good located? Pray tell us, Great Messenger and Spy.’
‘It’s where you don’t think or care to look. Otherwise, you would
nd that it’s within you; and you wouldn’t go wandering o among
externals, which are none of yours.  Turn your attention on
yourself – examine your belief system. What is the good as you
feature it?’
‘It means serenity, happiness and independence.’
‘Very good.  But doesn’t it also appear naturally great in your
imagination, priceless and invulnerable to harm? Where are you
going to nd serenity and independence – in something free, or
something enslaved?’
‘Free.’
‘And your body – is it free or slave?’
‘I don’t know.’
‘You are aware, I presume, that it is subject to fever, gout, rheum
and dysentery, not to mention despots, res and weapons –
anything, in a word, that is physically stronger?’
‘I agree, it is subject to these.’
 ‘So how can the body or any of its parts be considered free –
or great, or priceless? In essence it is a corpse, a thing of mud and
dust. Do you have anything that is free?’
 ‘Now I’m inclined to think not.’
‘Look, can you be forced to assent to what appears to you wrong?’
‘No.’
‘Or to dissent from the plain truth?’
‘No.’
‘Then you see you do have within you a share of freedom. 
And can any of you have the will to desire or avoid, choose or
refuse, plan or anticipate, if you don’t rst formulate the impression
of something advantageous or improper?’
‘No.’
‘So here, too, you have a measure of freedom and independence.
 Poor devil, why not try focusing on that, why not look after
that, for a change; that’s where you should go looking for the good.’
 How can someone who has nothing – no clothes, no hearth
or home, no luxuries, no slaves, no city he can call his own – how is
it possible for a person like that to be happy?  Well, God has
sent among you a person who will prove by example that it can be
done.  ‘Look at me, I have no home, no city, no property, no
slave; I sleep on the ground; I haven’t a wife or children, no ocer’s
quarters – just earth, and sky, and one lousy cloak. What more do I
need?  I am cheerful, I am tranquil and I am free. You’ve never
seen me fail to get what I want, or get what I try to avoid. I have
never been angry with God or another human being; I’ve never
yelled at anyone. Have you ever seen me with a sad expression?
 The people before whom you bow and tremble – when I meet
them, I treat them as if they were slaves. In fact, whenever they see
me, they all without exception think that they are in the presence of
their lord and master.’
 There you have the words of the authentic Cynic, words that
faithfully reect his purpose and personality. Most of you, however,
identify the Cynic with minor details like his satchel, his stick and
large jaws – large, I suppose, the better to wolf down the food he’s
given (if he doesn’t hoard it) – or with his embarrassing habit of
shouting abuse at passers-by, or with the broad shoulder he leaves
bare.19
 You see how big the project is that you propose to take on.
First, get a mirror – look at your shoulders, check out your loins,
examine your thighs; you are about to sign up for the Olympics, not
some desultory, imaginary match.  If you lose at the Olympics
you cannot just leave, you have to suer the indignity of having the
whole world watch – not just Athenians, Spartans or the citizens of
Nicopolis – everyone. A casual contestant will be trounced, but not
before he suers thirst, endures heat exhaustion and swallows
handfuls of sand.
 Plan carefully, know your limits, be reasonable and don’t go
forward without God’s say-so. If he picks you, be aware that in
addition to greatness his plans for you entail a good deal of
discomfort.  Because this is a particularly charming clause in
the Cynic contract: you are going to be beaten like a donkey, and
must love your tormentors as if you were their father or brother.
 Or would you rather invoke the emperor in their presence:
‘Caesar, you may have brought peace to the world, but look at the
violence I have to put up with! Take me to the proconsul at once.’20
 Caesar and the proconsul mean nothing to the Cynic; he only
calls upon Zeus, whom he serves as ambassador. If he suers some
hardship, he is condent that it is only Zeus putting him through his
paces.  I mean, Heracles did not wallow in self-pity when he
performed his labours for Eurystheus; he did what he was told
without reluctance. So the Cynic, who takes his orders from Zeus,
and has earned the right to carry the sta of Diogenes – should we
expect him to hesitate or complain?
 Listen to how Diogenes, laid low with fever, still lectured
passers-by: ‘Idiots, where are you going in such a hurry? You are
going a great distance to see those damned athletes compete;∗ why
not stop a bit to see a man do combat with illness?’  A man of
his mettle is not one to accuse God, who chose him, of unfairness in
making him ill. He positively prides himself on his hardships and is
bold enough to be a roadside attraction. What would he blame God
for? That he cuts such an admirable gure? What would the charge
be? That his virtue is too glaringly bright?  Here, just remember
what he says about poverty, death and pain; how he compares his
happiness with that of the Great King.21 Or rather, he doesn’t think
there is any comparison.  For where you nd unrest, grief, fear,
frustrated desire, failed aversion, jealousy and envy, happiness has
no room for admittance. And where values are false, these passions
inevitably follow.
 The young man asked, if he got sick, whether as a Cynic he
should consent to receive a friend to help take care of him.
Yes, but where are you going to nd a Cynic’s friend?  He
would have to be someone just like him, to be worthy of being
called his friend. He would have to share equally in the sceptre and
the kingdom.22 It is a worthy minister indeed who deserves a
Cynic’s friendship, as Diogenes was worthy of Antisthenes, and
Crates of Diogenes.  Don’t imagine that it is enough to become
his friend and be accepted into his home  just to go up to a
Cynic and introduce yourself. If that’s your plan, better start looking
for a nice rubbish dump in the event of illness – one protected from
the north wind, so you don’t catch your death of cold. 
Friendship, it seems to me, discourses means no more to you than
moving in with somebody and sponging o him or her
indenitely.23 You have no business contemplating so great a
project as Cynicism.
 ‘Well,’ the young man said, ‘what about marriage and
children – will the Cynic choose to take these duties on?’
Give me a state composed of wise men, and you may not be able
to nd a single person adopting the profession of Cynic. For whose
sake, after all, would one take on so rigorous a way of life? 
Still, if we suppose that there is a Cynic there, I see no reason why
he should not marry and have children. His wife will be wise, like
him, and like her father; and their children will grow up to be the
same.
 But with things as they are – in a virtual crisis – it’s better,
perhaps, that the Cynic not be distracted by domestic duties. He
needs to focus on his sacred ministry, and be free to move around –
not be tied down by personal obligations that he cannot very well
ignore, but which, if he honours, will detract from his role as
messenger, scout and herald of the gods.  Consider the
responsibilities he owes to his father-in-law and his wife’s other
relations, to his wife as well; in the end, he is reduced to the role of
nurse and provider.  To give just a few examples: he has to nd
a pot to heat water for the baby, and a tub to bathe it in; wool for
his wife after she’s given birth, together with oil, a cot, a drinking
cup – the list of accessories is already long.  And he has other
duties and distractions. In the end, what’s left of that king devoted
to the commons – the king who has the people in his care, and so
many concerns?
24 Where is the king whose duty it is to watch over
others who have married and got children, to see which of them is
treating his wife well, which badly, who is quarrelling, which
households are prospering, which are in decline?
In eect, he makes rounds like a doctor, taking his patients’ pulse,
alternately saying,  ‘You have a fever, you have a headache, you
have gout; you should fast, you should eat, you should not bathe;
you need an operation, you have to be cauterized.’  How is
someone encumbered by private duties going to nd time for this?
And he has to put little coats on his children’s backs, and send them
o to school with little notebooks and little pens, and make up a
little bed for them at night; because, after all, his children will not
be Cynics straight out of the womb.25 If he does not do all this for
them, he would have done better to expose them at birth, rather
than kill them by long neglect.  Now look at the condition
we’ve reduced our Cynic to – he’s more a butler than a king.
 ‘Yes, but Crates had a wife.’26 You are talking about a
circumstance that arose out of love, and a wife who was Crates’
virtual twin. We, on the other hand, are discussing normal
marriages, not special circumstances; and our analysis has not
discovered, in our present state, that marriage is advisable for the
Cynic.
 ‘Then how will he help the community carry on?’
For God’s sake, who benets society more, people who produce
two or three brats with runny noses to survive them or those who
supervise in each person’s life what they care about, or mistakenly
neglect?  Who beneted the Thebans more – those who gave
them children, or Epaminondas, who died childless? Did Priam,
with his fty worthless sons, or Danaus, or Aeolus, contribute more
to society than Homer?27  Their contribution to society as poet,
or general, is considered more than fair return for their failure to
marry or have children; should not the kingdom of the Cynic be
reckoned reasonable exchange as well?
 I fear we don’t appreciate its grandeur, nor do we have a fair
idea of Diogenes’ character. We are inuenced by the sad spectacle
of today’s Cynics, these dogs who beg at table and hang about the
gate28 who have nothing in common with the Cynics of old except
maybe for farting in public, not much else.  Because, if we did,
we would not be surprised or disappointed if a Cynic does not marry
or procreate. My friend, he fathers everyone: every man is his son,
every woman his daughter. That is how he regards everyone, and
how much he cares for them.  Don’t think he hectors strangers
in a spirit of impudence; he is acting like a father, or a brother – like
the vicar of God, the father of everyone.
 Now go on, ask me whether he will take part in public life.
 Look, is any form of public life superior to his? Why should he
stoop to preparing speeches about income and expenditures for the
Athenians, say, when he is called upon to address everyone –
Athenians, Corinthians, Romans – and not about debits and credits,
or war and peace, but about happiness and unhappiness, success
and misfortune, freedom and slavery?  You are asking me if
someone will take part in politics when they are already engaged in
politics on a major scale. Ask me further if he will hold oce, and
again I will say to you, ‘Fool, what oce is superior to the one he
has?’
 Furthermore, the Cynic’s body should be in good shape,
since his philosophy will not carry as much conviction coming from
someone pale and sickly.  He not only needs to show his
qualities of soul in order to convince ordinary people that it is
possible to be a gentleman without the material goods they usually
admire, he also has to prove, with his physique, that his simple,
frugal life outdoors is wholesome.  ‘What I testify to, my body
testies to as well.’ Which is what Diogenes did: he went about with
a healthy glow on his face, and his body alone was enough to win
the common people over.  A Cynic who excites pity is taken for
a beggar; everyone is disgusted and walks around him. The Cynic
shouldn’t be so lthy that he drives people away; his very
ruggedness should be of a clean and pleasant kind.
 The Cynic ought to be naturally sharp and witty, too
(otherwise he’s just a boring windbag), to be equal to every occasion
that calls for a quick reply –  the way Diogenes responded to
the man who greeted him with, ‘So Diogenes, you don’t believe the
gods exist?’ with ‘How can you say that, when I know that you are
headed for hell?’  Or again, when Alexander the Great stood
over him while he was resting, and recited: A man charged with
making decisions shouldn’t sleep the night away, Diogenes, still halfasleep, replied: Who has the people in his care, and so many
concerns.
29
 Above all, though, his mind should be purer than the sun,
because anyone guilty of wrongdoing who presumes to lecture
others can only be considered slick and unscrupulous.  For you
see how it is: the kings and tyrants of this world, even if they are
corrupt, can reprimand and punish oenders by virtue of their arms
and soldiers; instead of weapons and bodyguards, his conscience
gives the Cynic the same authority.  For he works overtime on
his fellow man’s behalf; what sleep he gets only leaves him purer
than when he rst lay down;30 his thoughts are never unworthy of a
friend and minister of the gods, and he shares in Zeus’
administration. ‘Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny’ is always on his lips,
as well as ‘If it pleases the gods, so be it.’  Conscious of all this,
why shouldn’t he venture to speak truth to his own brothers, his
own children – his own relations, in a word?
 A person of his conscience is neither bossy nor ocious; he
is not poking into other people’s business when he looks after the
common welfare, he is tending to his own. If you disagree, then by
your lights a general who inspects, drills and oversees his troops,
punishing those who get out of line, is intrusive too.
 If, however, you reprimand others with a bit of cake under
your arm, I will say, Wouldn’t you rather go and wolf down in
secret what you’ve stolen there?  What are other people’s aairs
to you? Who are you – are you the bull, or the queen of the hive?
Show me proof of your authority, such as the queen is endowed
with by nature. If you are a drone disputing control over the bees,
expect your fellow citizens to get rid of you, just as worker bees get
rid of the drones.
 The Cynic’s powers of endurance should be such that he
appears to most people insensible, a veritable block of wood. As far
as he’s concerned, nobody insults or hits or hurts him. He has
personally surrendered his body to be used or abused however
anyone likes.  He knows that whatever is inferior, in that
respect in which it is inferior, must yield to what is superior; and
that his body is inferior to the crowd – what’s physically weaker, in
other words, is inferior to what is physically stronger.  So he
never condescends to compete with them on their level. He has
completely renounced things outside himself and makes no claim to
things that are by nature enslaved.
 But when it comes to matters of the will and the use of
impressions, then you’ll see how many eyes he has – enough to
make Argus seem blind by comparison.31  With him there is no
premature assent, mistaken impulse, frustrated desire, unsuccessful
aversion or unrealized purpose; hence no blame, envy or
humiliation.  All his eort and energy go into this. As for the
rest, he yawns away, in a state of perfect indierence. Of free will
there can be neither thief nor tyrant;  of the body, however,
yes. Of material things? Yes. Of honours and oces – yes. Which is
why he is not interested in them. When someone tries using these
things to aect him, he says, ‘Go look for children to intimidate;
masks are meant to frighten them; I know there’s nothing behind
them.’
 This, then, is the nature of Cynicism. You consider
undertaking it; then please take some time to judge your aptitude.
 And remember what Hector said to Andromache:
No, go inside, and see to your weaving instead. Men will see to war;
men, and me in particular.
32  He sensed both his own
endowment, you see, and his wife’s incapacity.
III 23 On rhetorical display
 First, tell yourself what you want to be, then act your part
accordingly. This, after all, is what we nd to be the rule in just
about every other eld.  Athletes decide rst what they want to
be, then proceed to do what is necessary. If they decide to be a
distance runner, it means one particular diet, racecourse, workout
and mode of physical therapy. If they want to be sprinters, those
factors are dierent. And if it’s a pentathlete they want to be, they
vary again.  You will nd the same thing true of the crafts. If you
want to be a carpenter, you will have one kind of training, if you
want to be a sculptor, quite another. All our eorts must be directed
towards an end, or we will act in vain. If it is not the right end, we
will fail utterly.
 Now, there are two standards of reference, one general and
one particular. To begin with, then, we must act like a human being,
which means, not like a sheep, however gentle, nor violently like a
wild beast. The particular standard relates to the skill and the end to
which it is put. The musician should act like a musician, the
carpenter like a carpenter, the philosopher like a philosopher, the
orator like an orator. Therefore, when you say,  ‘Come and hear
me lecture,’ be sure you have a purpose in lecturing. When you nd
your direction, check to make sure that it is the right one.  Is
your goal to educate or be praised?
Right away the answer comes back, ‘What do I care for the praise
of the vulgar masses?’ And those are ne words. The musician too,
qua musician, does not care about praise, any more than praise
matters to a mathematician.
 So you aim to educate, you say. But for what purpose? Tell us,
so we will go running to the auditorium too. Can anyone educate
others, though, if they have not rst been educated themselves? No
– any more than a person who is not a carpenter can give lessons in
carpentry, or someone who is not a cobbler can give lessons in
making shoes.  Do you want to know if you are educated? Show
us your values, philosopher. What is the goal of the faculty of
desire? ‘Not to fail in desire.’  Of aversion? ‘Not to get what it
doesn’t want.’ Well – are we meeting these goals? Tell me the truth;
because if you lie, I will say to you, ‘The other day your audience
greeted you rather coolly∗ and didn’t applaud– and you left
dejected.  Another day, having been acclaimed, you went
around and said to everyone, ‘How do you think I did?’
‘Splendidly, sir, on my word.’
‘How did that one part come o?’
‘Which?’
‘The one where I described Pan and the Nymphs.’33
 ‘It was marvellous!’
‘Then you try to tell me that with regard to desire and aversion
you are behaving in line with nature? Get lost, try telling it to
somebody else.  Didn’t you praise someone just the other day in
deance of your true opinion? Weren’t you sucking up to some
ocer? How would you like it if your children acted that way?’
 ‘God forbid.’
‘Then why were you praising and extolling him so?’
‘He’s a clever young man and a fan of rhetoric.’
‘How do you know?’
‘He praises me.’
Oh, well, that proves it, of course. Look, what do you think is
really going on? Don’t these same people secretly despise you? 
I mean, if someone hears himself described by a philosopher as ‘a
great talent, ingenuous and unspoiled’ when he’s well aware that he
hasn’t done the man any good or even wished him well, what must
he be thinking except, ‘He must want me for some favour or
another.’  If that’s wrong, then tell me, what sign of great talent
has he displayed? I mean, he’s been with you for some time, he’s
heard you engage in dialogue, he’s heard you lecture on philosophy
– has he gained self-control, has he taken himself in hand, has he
come to a realization of his faults?  Has he shed his
presumption, and begun looking for a teacher?
‘He has.’
One who will teach him how to live? No, fool – one who will
teach him how to turn a phrase instead; because that is precisely
what he admires you for. Just listen to what he says: ‘This person
writes with great sophistication, much better than Dio.’34  It’s a
whole other matter. He doesn’t say, ‘The man is civil, he is constant,
he is calm.’ And even if he had said it, I would have asked, ‘Since
this man is constant, what characteristics does the constant man
have?’35 And if he could not say, I would have added, ‘Understand
what words you use rst, then use them.’  So in your sorry state
– eager for admirers, counting the number of audience members –
do you intend to come to others’ assistance?
‘Today I had a much bigger audience.’
‘There certainly was a crowd.’
‘I put the turnout at around ve hundred.’
‘Nonsense, it was a thousand at least.’
‘That many never showed up to hear Dio.’
‘Him? Never.’
‘And it was a sophisticated audience, too, where their taste in
rhetoric was concerned.’
‘Sir, beauty can even move a stone.’
 There are the words of a philosopher for you, and the
character of a man bound to benet humanity! There’s one who has
listened to reason, certainly, and read the Socratic discourses as
coming from Socrates, not from Lysias or Isocrates.36
‘I often wondered by what sort of arguments…’37
‘Stop right there: “… by what sort of argument” reads better.’
 You read them as if they were pretty poems. If you read
them properly, you wouldn’t care about that, you would attend
more to this: ‘Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot harm
me.’38 ‘I’ve always been the sort to attend to the argument that
seems best to me upon inspection, even to the detriment of my own
aairs.’39  Which is why no one ever heard him say, ‘I know
something and I teach it.’40
 No, I suppose you think he would say to his companion,
‘Come listen to me speak today at the house of Codratus.’
Why should I hear you speak? You want to show me that you
arrange words elegantly? So you do; but what do you gain by it?
‘You’re supposed to praise me.’
 ‘What do you mean, “praise me” ’?
‘Shout “bravo!” and “marvellous!”’
Fine, I’ll shout it. But if praise is one of those things that
philosophers categorize as ‘good’, then how can I praise you? Teach
me that it is good to be eloquent, and I will praise you.
 Should listening to speeches be an experience totally devoid
of pleasure, then? Of course not. I take pleasure in listening to lyre
players, too. But is that good enough reason for me to get up and
play the lyre? Listen to what Socrates says: ‘It would not suit me at
my age, gentlemen, to come before you formulating phrases like a
callow youth.’41  It is an exquisite little art, this choosing up
words, joining them together, then appearing in public to give them
an artistic reading. And how delightful if during the recital someone
shouts out, ‘Not many people can appreciate this, by God!’∗
 Does a philosopher solicit an audience? As the sun draws
sustenance to itself, that is how a true philosopher attracts people
who stand in need of help.42 What sort of doctor is it that invites
patients to be treated by him? And yet I hear that in Rome now
even the doctors advertise for patients. In my day it was the other
way around.  ‘I invite you to come and hear how unwell you
are. How you care for everything except what counts. How you
don’t know good from evil. That you are unhappy and unsuccessful.’
What a charming invitation! And yet if the philosopher does not
make such an impression with his speech, it’s dead, and the speaker
might as well be too.  Rufus43 used to say, ‘If you have nothing
better to do than praise me for it, then my speech was a failure.’ He
used to address us in such a way as to make everyone sitting there
suppose that someone had informed on them – that’s how well he
intuited the truth, and how vividly he evoked for each one of us our
private faults.
 Friends, the school of a philosopher is a hospital. When you
leave, you should have suered, not enjoyed yourself. Because you
enter, not in a state of health, but with a dislocated shoulder, it may
be, or an abscess, a stula, or head pain.  So am I supposed to
sit down alongside you and recite clever thoughts and phrases, so
that patients applaud and leave with their shoulder in the same
condition as when they were admitted, their head, their abscess,
their stula the same?  Is it for this that young people should
travel abroad, leaving behind their parents, friends, relations and
possessions – all so that they can say ‘Bravo!’ when you deliver your
clever phrases? Is this what Socrates, Zeno or Cleanthes did?
 ‘Well, isn’t there the protreptic style of discourse?’ Naturally
– as there are the elenctic and didactic styles. But whoever included
the epideictic style in the curriculum as a fourth subject?44  The
hortatory style purports to expose to all the conict in which they
are embroiled, and how they are interested in everything except
what they want. Because what people want is what conduces to
happiness; but they look for it in the wrong place.  If this is to
happen, do we really need a thousand chairs set up, invitations sent
out and the speaker turned out in a fancy robe or gown, astride a
podium, narrating the death of Achilles? For gods’ sake, do your
best to honour such famous names and deeds by forbearing to name
them.
 There is nothing more inspiring than a speaker who makes
clear to his audience that he has need of them.  Tell me – has
anyone who has ever heard you read or discourse felt self-remorse
as a result, or experienced self-realization, or afterwards left
thinking, ‘The philosopher touched a nerve there; I can’t go on
acting as I have’?
 No; if you perform really well, one says to another, ‘He put
the bit about Xerxes nicely, I thought,’ and another says, ‘I liked his
description of the battle of Thermopylae better.’
Does that sound like the lecture of a philosopher?
BOOK IV
IV 1 On freedom
 Free is the person who lives as he wishes and cannot be coerced,
impeded or compelled, whose impulses cannot be thwarted, who
always gets what he desires and never has to experience what he
would rather avoid.
Now, who would want to go through life ignorant of how to
achieve this?
‘No one.’
 Who wants to live with delusion and prejudice, being unjust,
undisciplined, mean and ungrateful?
‘No one.’
 No bad person, then, lives the way he wants, and no bad man
is free.  Who wants to live life experiencing sadness, envy and
pity, being frustrated in their desires and liable to experience what
they want to avoid?
‘No one.’
 So, can we nd any bad person who is without sadness, fear,
frustration or misfortune?
‘No.’
No more, then, can we nd one who is free.
 Now, a two-term consul will tolerate such talk only on
condition that you add, ‘But you know that already; it hardly applies
to you.’ If you tell him the truth and say,  ‘You’re just as much
enslaved as someone sold into captivity three times over,’ don’t
expect anything but a punch in the nose. ‘How am I a slave?’ he
wants to know.  ‘My father is free, my mother is free, and there is
no deed of sale for me. Add to which I’m a senator, I’m a personal
friend of Caesar, I’ve been a consul and I own many slaves
personally.’  In the rst place, Senator, sir, your father could
have been slavish in the same respect as you, along with your
mother, your grandfather and all your ancestors down the line. 
And even if they were as free as free can be, what does that have to
do with you? Suppose that they were noble, and you are depraved?
Or that they were courageous, whereas you are a coward? Or that
they were disciplined, while you are dissolute?
 ‘What’s that got to do with being a slave?’
Doesn’t it seem to you that acting against one’s will, under protest
and compulsion, is tantamount to being a slave?
 ‘Maybe, but who has power to compel me except Caesar,
who rules over everyone?’
 So you admit that you have at least one master. And don’t let
the fact that Caesar rules over everyone, as you say, console you: it
only means that you’re a slave in a very large household.  You
remind me of the citizens of Nicopolis, who are forever proclaiming,
‘By the grace of Caesar, we are free.’1
 If you like, however, for the moment we’ll leave Caesar out
of account. Just tell me this: haven’t you ever been in love with
someone, be they man or woman, slave or free?
 ‘How does that aect whether I am slave or free?’
 Weren’t you ever commanded by your sweetheart to do
something you didn’t want to do? Did you never atter your pet
slave, and even kiss her feet? And yet if someone were to force you
to kiss Caesar’s feet, you’d regard it as hubris and the height of
tyranny.
 If your lovesick condition isn’t slavery, then what is? Didn’t
you ever risk going out at night where you didn’t want to go, spend
more money than you had intended, say things in the course of the
evening in accents of misery and woe, put up with being mocked,
and nally locked out?  If you’re too embarrassed to share your
own experience, though, just consider the words and actions of
Thrasonides, who fought more campaigns, perhaps, than you.2 To
begin with, he went out at a time of night that even his slave
wouldn’t dare do, or if forced to, only with much moaning and
groaning about his bitter condition.  And what does
Thrasonides say? ‘A pretty woman has made of me a perfect slave,
something not even my ercest enemies could accomplish.’ 
Poor guy, to be enslaved to a whore, and a cheap one at that! What
right do you still have to call yourself free? What point is there in
boasting about your military victories?
 Then the man calls for a sword to end it all, yells at the slave
who refuses to give him one out of compassion, sends gifts to his
girl – who still despises him – begs and implores her and rejoices
when he meets with the least success.  But until he succeeds in
suppressing his lust and anxiety, how is he really free?
 Consider how we apply the idea of freedom to animals. 
There are tame lions that people cage, raise, feed and take with
them wherever they go. Yet who will call such a lion free? The
easier its life, the more slavish it is. No lion endowed with reason
and discretion would choose to be one of these pet specimens.
 The birds above us, when they are caught and raised in a
cage, will try anything for the sake of escape. Some starve to death
rather than endure their condition.  Those that survive – barely,
grudgingly, wasting away – y o in an instant when they nd the
least little opening to squeeze through, so great is their need for
their native freedom, so strong the desire to be independent and
unconned.  ‘Well, what’s wrong with you here in your cage?’
‘You can ask? I was born to y wherever I like, to live in the open
air, to sing whenever I want. You take all this away from me and
then say, “What’s wrong with you?” ’
 For this reason we will only call those animals free that
refuse to tolerate captivity and escape instead by dying as soon as
they are caught.  Apropos of which, Diogenes says somewhere
that one way to guarantee freedom is to be ready to die. To the
Persian king he wrote, ‘You can no more make slaves of the
Athenians than you can make slaves of the sh of the sea.’ 
‘Why? Can’t Athenians be captured?’ ‘Capture them, and straight
away they’ll give you the slip and be gone, like sh, which die
directly they are caught and taken on board. And if the Athenians
die when taken captive, what good in the end is all your military
might?’  There’s the word of a free man who has given the
subject of freedom considerable thought and, sure enough,
discovered the real meaning of the word. If you continue to look for
it in the wrong place, however, don’t be surprised if you never nd
it.
 The slave urgently prays to be emancipated. Why? Do you
suppose it’s because he can’t wait to pay the tax collector the ve
per cent tax?3 No, it’s because he imagines that, lacking liberty, he’s
been thwarted and unhappy all his life up to then.  ‘Once I’m
set free,’ he says, ‘everything will be roses right away. I won’t have
to wait on anybody, I can talk to everyone as an equal and a peer,
travel wherever I like, come and go as I please.’
 Then he is liberated, but now, lacking a place to eat, he
looks around for someone to sweet-talk and dine with. Next he
resorts to prostitution and, if he gets a sugar daddy, he suers the
most degrading fate of all, having now fallen into a far more abject
slavery than the one he escaped.  Even if he succeeds on his
own, his low breeding makes him fall in love with a common
prostitute. When she refuses him he falls apart and longs to be a
slave again.
 ‘What did I lack then, anyway? Another person supplied me
with clothes, shoes and food and took care of me when I was sick;
and I had little enough to do by way of service in return. Now I go
through hell catering to many people instead of just the one. 
Still – if I can only manage to get a ring on my nger, then nally
my life will be blissful and complete.’4 Well, to get it he has to
endure the usual humiliations; and once he has it, it’s the same old
story again.
 So then he thinks: ‘If I serve a stint in the military all my
troubles will be over.’ Consequently he joins the army, suers
everything a rank-and-le soldier has to suer, and enlists for a
second and then a third tour of duty.5  Finally, when he crowns
it o by becoming a senator, then he becomes a slave in ne
company, then he experiences the poshest and most prestigious
form of enslavement.
 No more foolishness. The man has to learn ‘what each
specic thing means’, as Socrates often said, and stop casually
applying preconceptions to individual cases.  This is the cause
of everyone’s troubles, the inability to apply common
preconceptions to particulars.6
Instead the opinions of men as to
what is bad diverge.∗  One thinks that he is unwell, when it’s
nothing of the kind; the problem is that he is not adapting
preconceptions correctly. One imagines that he is poor, another that
he has a dicult mother or father, still another that Caesar is not
disposed in his favour. This is all caused by one and the same thing,
namely, ignorance of how to apply one’s preconceptions.
 Who, after all, does not have a preconception of ‘bad’, to the
eect that it is harmful, that it should be avoided, and that we
should use every means to get rid of it? One preconception does not
conict with another,  conict arises when it comes to their
application. What is this ‘bad’, then, which is also harmful and
needs to be avoided? One says it’s not being Caesar’s friend:7 he’s
o the mark, he’s not applying preconceptions properly, and is
distressed because he’s stuck on something that doesn’t meet the
denition. Because if he succeeds in securing Caesar’s friendship he
still hasn’t got what he wants –  the same thing, really, that we
all want: to live in peace, to be happy, to do as we like and never be
foiled or forced to act against our wishes.
When a man gains Caesar’s friendship, does he stop being
hindered or constrained, does he live in peace and happiness?
Whom should we ask? Well, who is more to be trusted than the
person who has actually gained his condence?  So step up, sir,
and tell us, when did you sleep more soundly, now or before you
became intimate with Caesar? ‘By the gods, stop mocking my
condition. You don’t know what agonies I endure. I can’t even fall
o to sleep before someone comes and announces, “The emperor is
up already, and about to make his appearance,” and then I’m
harassed by one worry and crisis after another.’
 Well, and when did you dine with greater contentment, now
or earlier? Hear him testify to this, too. He says that if he’s not
invited to dine with Caesar, he’s an emotional wreck; and if he is
invited, he behaves like a slave asked to sit beside his master,
anxious the whole time lest he say or do something gauche. But is
he afraid that, like a slave, he’ll get whipped? He should be so
lucky. As bets a personage as lofty as a friend of Caesar, he’s afraid
his head will be chopped o.
 When did you bathe with more ease, when were you more
relaxed at your exercise – in a word, which life would you prefer,
the present or the previous one?  I could swear that there is no
one so crude or forgetful that they don’t actually regret their fortune
in precise proportion to how close to Caesar they’ve become.
 Well, if neither kings, so-called, nor their companions live as
they please, who is left that can be considered free? Look and you
will nd: nature has endowed you with resources to discover the
truth. And if you can’t infer the answer yourself using only these
resources,  listen to what those who have explored the question
have to say:
‘Do you think freedom is something good?’
‘The greatest good of all.’
‘Can anyone in possession of the greatest good be unhappy or
unfortunate?’
‘No.’
‘Anyone you see who is unhappy, then, malcontent or
disheartened, you can condently characterize as not being free?’
‘Yes.’
 Now we have surely advanced beyond consideration of
buying, selling and other such mundane transactions.8 Because if
you were right to agree to what we said above, then if he is
unhappy the Great King himself cannot be free, nor can any prince,
consul or two-term consul.
‘Granted.’
 Well, then, answer me something else: do you think freedom
is grand and glorious, a thing of some signicance?
‘Of course.’
And can anyone possessed of something so grand, glorious and
important feel inferior?
‘Impossible.’
 Then whenever you see someone grovel before another, or
atter them insincerely, you can safely assume that that person is
not free – and not just if a meal is at stake, but even when they
abase themselves for the sake of a governorship or consulship. In
fact, you can call the people who behave that way for small gains
petty slaves, while the latter deserve to be called slaves on a grand
scale.
 ‘I would have to agree with that too.’
And do you think of freedom as something autonomous and selfsucient?
‘Yes.’
Then whoever is liable to be hindered or compelled by someone
else is assuredly not free.  And please don’t research the status
of their grandfather and great-grandfather, or inquire into whether
they were bought or sold. If you hear someone say ‘Master’ sincerely
and with feeling, call him a slave no matter if twelve bodyguards9
march ahead of him. Or if you hear, ‘God, the things I put up with!’,
call the person a slave. If you just see him disconsolate, angry or out
of sorts, call him a slave – albeit a slave in a purple toga.
 Even if he does none of these things, don’t call him free just
yet, acquaint yourself with his judgements, in case they show any
sign of constraint, disappointment or disaection. And if you nd
him so disposed, call him a slave on holiday at the Saturnalia.10 Say
that his master is away; when he returns, the man’s true condition
will be made plain to you.
 ‘When who returns?’
Whoever has the means to give or take away any of the things he
values.
‘Do we have that many masters?’
We do. Because over and above the rest we have masters in the
form of circumstances, which are legion. And anyone who controls
any one of them controls us as well.  No one, you realize, fears
Caesar himself, it is death, exile, dispossession, jail and
disenfranchisement that they are afraid of. Nor is Caesar loved,
unless by chance he is personally deserving; we love money, a
tribuneship, a military command or consulship. But when we love,
hate or fear such things, then the people who administer them are
bound to become our masters.  As a result we even honour
them as gods, because we associate godhead with whatever has the
capacity to confer most benet. Then we posit a false minor
premise: this man has the power to confer the most benet. And the
conclusion that follows from these premises is necessarily false as
well.11
 What is it then that renders a person free and independent?
Money is not the answer, nor is a governorship, a consulship, or
even a kingdom.  Something else needs to be found. Well, what
makes for freedom and uency in the practice of writing?
Knowledge of how to write. The same goes for the practice of
playing an instrument. It follows that, in the conduct of life, there
must be a science to living well.  Now, you have heard this
stated as a general principle, consider how it is borne out in
particular cases. Take someone in want of something under the
control of people other than himself; is it possible for him to be
unrestricted or unrestrained?
‘No.’
 Consequently he cannot be free either. Now consider: is
there nothing that is under our control, is everything under our
control – or are there some things we control, and others that we
don’t?
‘What do you mean?’
 Is it within your power to have your body perform perfectly
whenever you want?
‘No.’
Or be in good health?
‘No.’
Or attractive?
‘Again, no.’
Well, then, the body isn’t yours, and is subject to everything
physically stronger.
‘Granted.’
 What about land – can you have as much as you want, for as
long as you want, in the condition you prefer?
‘No.’
And what about slaves?
‘No again.’
Clothing?
‘No.’
Your house?
‘No.’
Your horses?
‘No to all of the above.’
And if more than anything else you want your children to live, or
your wife, your brother, or your friends, is this within your power to
eect?
‘No, that isn’t either.’
 Is there nothing that is under your authority, that you have
exclusive control over – does anything of the kind exist?
‘I don’t know.’
 Well, look at it this way. Can anyone make you assent to a
false proposition?
‘No, no one can.’
So in the eld of assent you cannot be hindered or obstructed.
‘Evidently.’
 And can anyone force you to choose something to which
you’re opposed?
‘They can: when they threaten me with death or imprisonment,
they compel my choice.’
But what if you despise death and imprisonment – are you still in
that person’s thrall?
‘No.’
 Is your attitude towards death your aair, then?
‘It is.’
Therefore your will is your own business too.
‘I grant it.’
And that goes for being opposed to something, also.
 ‘But suppose I choose to walk, and someone obstructs me?’
What part of you will they obstruct? Certainly not your power of
assent?
‘No, my body.’
Your body, yes – as they might obstruct a rock.
‘Perhaps; but the upshot is, now I’m not allowed to walk.’
 Whoever told you, ‘Walking is your irrevocable privilege’? I
said only that the will to walk could not be obstructed. Where use of
the body and its cooperation are concerned, you’ve long been told
that that isn’t your responsibility.
 ‘Very well.’
And can you be forced by anyone to desire something against
your will?
‘No.’
Or to plan for, or project – or, in a word, regard outside
impressions in any one way at all?
 ‘No again. But when I’ve already conceived a wish for
something, they can stop me from getting it.’
If you wish for something that is under your authority and cannot
be obstructed, how will they stop you?
‘They can’t.’
And who says if you desire something outside your authority that
you cannot be obstructed?
 ‘Well, should I not desire health, then?’
No – nor, for that matter, anything else outside the limits of your
authority;  and whatever you cannot produce or preserve at will
lies outside your range. Don’t let your hands go near it, much less
your desire. Otherwise you’ve consigned yourself to slavery and
submitted your neck to the yoke, as you do whenever you prize
something not yours to command, or grow attached to something
like health that’s contingent on God’s will and variable, unstable,
unpredictable and unreliable by nature.
 ‘So my arm isn’t mine either?’
It’s a part of you, but by nature it is dirt, subject to restraint and
main force, a slave to anything physically stronger.  And why
single the arm out? For as long as its time lasts the whole body
should be treated like a loaded donkey. If a donkey is requisitioned
and seized by a soldier, let it go: don’t resist or complain, or you’ll
be beaten, and lose the animal all the same.  And if this is how
you should treat the body, what treatment should be reserved for
the things that serve the body? If it’s a donkey, then they are the
donkey’s bridle, pack saddle, shoes, barley and feed. Let them go
too, give them up with even more speed and good grace than you
did the animal.
 When you’re thus practised and prepared to discriminate
between what belongs to you and what doesn’t, what is subject to
hindrance and what is not, and are ready to regard the latter as
important to you and the former as irrelevant, then is there anyone,
any more, you need be frightened of?
‘No.’
 No; because what would you fear them for? Not the things
that are your own, that constitute the essence of what is good and
bad, because no one has power over them but you. You can no more
be blocked or deprived of them than can God.∗  Perhaps you
fear for the body and material possessions – things that lie outside
your scope of responsibility and have no meaning for you. But what
else have you been doing from the start except distinguishing
between what you own and what you don’t, between what is in your
power and what is not, between what is subject to hindrance and
what isn’t? Why else have you been frequenting philosophers? So
that you could be as lost and unhappy as you were before?  In
that case you will never be free of fear or anxiety – or sorrow, which
does you no credit either, seeing as fear for future evils turns to
sorrow when they turn up.
Nor should you feel irrational desire any more. You have a xed
and measured desire for the goods of the soul, since they are within
your power and accessible. You disdain external goods, so that no
opening exists for that irrational, intemperate and impulsive form of
desire.  With such an attitude toward things, you can no longer
be intimidated by anyone. What can one human being nd strange
or frightful in a fellow human’s appearance, conversation or
companionship generally? Nothing – any more than one horse, or
dog, or bee is frightening to another of its kind. People nd
particular things, however, frightening; and it’s when someone is
able to threaten or entice us with those that the man himself
becomes frightening.
 How is a fortress demolished?12 Not with weapons or re –
with judgements. We can capture the physical fortress, the one in
the city, but our judgements about illness, or about attractive
women, remain to be dislodged from the fortress inside us, together
with the tyrants whom we host every day, though their identities
change over time.  It’s here that we need to start attacking the
fortress and driving the tyrants out. Surrender the body and its
members, physical faculties, property, reputation, oce, honours,
children, siblings – repudiate them all.  And if the tyrants are
expelled from it, the fortress itself will not have to be destroyed,
not, at least as far as I’m concerned. For it does me no harm while it
stands.
The tyrants’ bodyguards, too, can stay, for how can they aect
me? Their sticks, their spears and their knives are meant for other
people.  I, personally, was never kept from something I wanted,
nor had forced upon me something I was opposed to. How did I
manage it? I submitted my will to God. He wants me to be sick –
well, then, so do I. He wants me to choose something. Then I choose
it. He wants me to desire something, I desire it. He wants me to get
something, I want the same; or he doesn’t want me to get it, and I
concur.  Thus I even assent to death and torture. Now no one
can make me, or keep me, from acting in line with my inclination,
any more than they can similarly manipulate God.
 This is the way circumspect travellers act. Word reaches
them that the road is beset with highwaymen. A solitary traveller
doesn’t like the odds, he waits in order to attach himself to an
ambassador, quaestor13 or provincial governor and only travels
securely once he’s part of their entourage.  Which is how a
prudent person proceeds along life’s road. He thinks, ‘There are
countless thieves and bandits, many storms, and many chances to
get lost or relieved of one’s belongings.  How are we to evade
them and come through without being attacked?  What party
should we wait to join, with whom should we enlist, to ensure safe
passage? With this man, perhaps – the person who is rich and
inuential? No, not much to be gained there; he’s liable to lose his
position, break down and prove of no use to me at all. And suppose
my travel companion himself betrays and robs me?
 ‘Well, then, I’ll become a friend of Caesar – no one will try to
take advantage of me as long as I am Caesar’s friend. But in the rst
place, what will I need to suer or sacrice in order to get close to
him? How much money will I have to spend, on how many people?
 And if I do manage it – well, after all, the emperor is mortal
too. Add to which, if by some mischance he becomes my enemy, I
suppose I will have no recourse except to ee and take refuge in the
wilderness.  But what about illness – I can’t escape that in the
wilderness. So what remains? Is no travel companion dependable,
honest and above suspicion?’
 By a process of logical elimination, the conclusion emerges
that we will come through safely only by allying ourselves with
God.
 ‘What do you mean, “allying ourselves”?’
Acting in such a way that, whatever God wants, we want too; and
by inversion whatever he does not want, this we do not want either.
 How can we do this? By paying attention to the pattern of
God’s purpose and design. To start with, then, what hashe given me
as mine outright, and what has hereserved to himself? He has
conferred on me the functions of the will, made them mine and
made them proof against resistance or obstruction. But the body,
which is made of clay – how could he make that unconstrained? So
he assigned it its place in the cosmic cycle – the same as other
material things like my furniture, my house, my wife and children.
 So don’t go up against God by hoping for what is
unattainable, namely to keep forever what doesn’t really belong to
you. Keep them in the spirit they were given, for as long as possible.
If he gives he also takes away. So why try and resist him? It would
be stupid to oppose one who is stronger than I, but more
importantly, it would be wrong.  For how did I come by these
belongings in the rst place? From my father – who got them from
his. Who created the sun, though, the fruits of the earth, and the
seasons? Who engineered mankind’s mutual attraction, and the
social order?
 When everything you have has been given you, including
your very existence, you proceed to turn on your benefactor and
fault him for taking things back.  Who are you, and how did
you get here? It was God brought you into the world, who showed
you the light, gave you the people who support you, gave you
reason and perception. And he brought you into the world as a
mortal, to pass your time on earth with a little endowment of esh,
to witness his design and share for a short time in his feast and
celebration.  So why not enjoy the feast and pageant while it’s
given you to do so; then, when he ushers you out, go with thanks
and reverence for what you were privileged for a time to see and
hear.
‘No, I want to keep celebrating.’
 Yes, just as initiates want the mysteries to continue, or
crowds at the Olympic Games want to see more contestants. But the
festival is over; leave and move on, grateful for what you’ve seen,
with your self-respect intact. Make room for other people, it’s their
turn to be born, just as you were born, and once born they need a
place to live, along with the other necessities of life. If the rst
people won’t step aside, what’s going to happen? Don’t be so
greedy. Aren’t you ever satised? Are you determined to make the
world more crowded still?
 ‘All right; but I’d like my wife and children to remain with
me.’
Why? Are they yours? They belong to the one who gave them to
you, the same one who created you. Don’t presume to take what
isn’t yours, or oppose one who is your better.
 ‘Why did he bring me into the world on these conditions?’
If the conditions don’t suit you, leave. He doesn’t need a heckler
in the audience. He wants people keen to participate in the dance
and revels – people, that is, who would sooner applaud and favour
the festival with their praise and acclamation.  As for those
who are grumpy and dour, he won’t be sad to see them excluded.
Even when they are invited, they don’t act as if they are on holiday,
or play an appropriate part; instead they whine, they curse their
fate, their luck and their company. They don’t appreciate what they
have, including moral resources given to them for the opposite
purpose – generosity of spirit, high-mindedness, courage and that
very freedom we are now exploring.
 ‘What did I get externals for, then?’
To use.
‘For how long?’
For as long as the one who gave them decides.
‘And if I can’t live without them?’
Don’t get attached to them and they won’t be. Don’t tell yourself
that they’re indispensable and they aren’t.
 Those are the reections you should recur to morning and
night. Start with things that are least valuable and most liable to be
lost – things such as a jug or a glass – and proceed to apply the same
ideas to clothes, pets, livestock, property; then to yourself, your
body, the body’s parts, your children, your siblings and your wife.
 Look on every side and mentally discard them. Purify your
thoughts, in case of an attachment or devotion to something that
doesn’t belong to you and will hurt to have wrenched away. 
And as you exercise daily, as you do at the gym, do not say that you
are philosophizing (admittedly a pretentious claim), but that you
are a slave presenting your emancipator;14 because this is genuine
freedom that you cultivate.
 This is the kind of freedom Diogenes got from Antisthenes,
saying he could never again be enslaved by anyone.  Which
explains his behaviour toward the pirates when they took him
captive.15 Did he call any of them ‘master’? No. And I don’t mean
the word; it’s not the word I’m concerned with, but the attitude
behind it.  He yelled at them for not feeding their captives
better. And when he was sold, it was not a master he looked to get,
but a slave of his own.
And how did he act toward his new owner? He at once began to
criticize him, saying that he shouldn’t dress this way, shouldn’t cut
his hair that way – besides advising him on how his sons should be
brought up.  And why not? If the owner had bought a personal
trainer, he would have acknowledged the trainer to be his superior,
not his slave, so far as exercise is concerned. The same goes if he
had bought a doctor or architect. In any eld you care to name, the
person with experience should command the one without.  So
whoever is possessed of knowledge about how to live should
naturally take precedence there. For who else is master of a ship
except the captain? Why? Just because whoever disobeys him is
punished?
 ‘But so-and-so can have me whipped.’
Not with impunity, however.
‘Well, so I believed too.’
And because he does not act with impunity, he does not act with
authority; no one can get away with injustice.
 ‘And what punishment do you foresee for the master who
puts his own slave in chains?’
The act itself of putting him in chains – an idea even you will
accept if you have any wish to honour the principle that human
beings are civilized animals, not beasts.  A plant or animal
fares poorly when it acts contrary to its nature;  and a human
being is no dierent. Well, then, biting, kicking, wanton
imprisonment and beheading – is that what our nature entails? No;
rather, acts of kindness, cooperation and good will. And so, whether
you like it or not, a person fares poorly whenever he acts like an
insensitive brute.
 ‘So you’re saying that Socrates did not fare poorly?’
That’s right – the jurors and his accusers did instead.
‘Nor Helvidius at Rome?’
No – but the person who killed him did.
‘How do you reckon that?’
 Well, you don’t call a ghting cock that’s bloodied but
victorious unfortunate, but rather one who lost without receiving a
scratch. And you don’t yell ‘Good dog!’ at one that doesn’t hunt or
work; you do it when you see one panting, labouring, exhausted
from the chase.  What’s odd in asserting that what’s bad for
anything is what runs contrary to its nature? You say it for
everything else, why make humanity the sole exception?
 Well, but we assert that in their nature human beings are
gentle, honest and cooperative – that’s pretty ridiculous, is it not?
No, that isn’t either –  which is why no one suers harm even
if they are ogged, jailed or beheaded. The victim may be majestic
in suering, you see, and come through a better, more fortunate
person; while the one who really comes to harm, who suers the
most and the most pitifully, is the person who is transformed from
human being to wolf, snake or hornet.
 All right then, let us go over the points we are agreed on.
The unhindered person is free, that is, the person who has ready
access to things in the condition he prefers. Whoever can be
thwarted, however, or coerced, frustrated or forced into a situation
against their will – that person is a slave.  The person who
renounces externals cannot be hindered, as externals are things that
are not within our power either to have or not to have – or to have
in the condition we might like.  Externals include the body
and its members, as well as material goods. If you grow attached to
any of them as if they were your own, you will incur the penalties
prescribed for a thief.
 This is the road that leads to liberty, the only road that
delivers us from slavery: nally to be able to say, with meaning:
Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny,
to the goal I was long ago assigned
 What about you, philosopher? The tyrant is going to call on
you to bear false witness. Tell us: do you play along or not?
‘Let me think it over.’
Think it over now? What were you thinking over in school? Didn’t
you rehearse which things are good, which are bad, and which are
neither?
 ‘I did.’
And what did you decide?
‘That justice and fairness are good, vice and injustice bad.’
Is life a good?
‘No.’
Is dying bad?
‘No.’
Or jail?
‘No.’
And what about slanderous and dishonest talk, betraying a friend,
and trying to ingratiate yourself with a tyrant – how exactly did you
characterize those?
 ‘As bad.’
Well, it’s obvious that you aren’t thinking it over, and you never
did think it over in the past. I mean, how much thought is really
required to decide whether you should exercise your power to get
the greatest goods and avoid the greatest evils? A t subject for
thought, no doubt, calling for a great deal of deliberation. Who are
you kidding? No such inquiry ever took place.  If you really
did believe that vice alone is bad and everything else indierent,
you never would have needed time to ‘think it over’ – far from it.
You’d be able to make a decision immediately, using your faculty of
reason as readily as sight.  I mean, when do you have to ‘think
over’ whether black things are white, or light things heavy? No, the
clear evidence of the senses is enough. So why say now that you
have to ‘think over’ whether indierents are more to be avoided
than evils?  The fact is, this is not what you really believe: you
don’t think that death and jail, etc. are indierent, you count them
among the greatest evils; and you don’t regard false witness, etc. as
evil, but matters of indierence.
 You’ve developed this habit from the beginning. ‘Where am
I? In school. And who is my audience? I’m conversing with
philosophers. But now that I’ve left school, away with those
pedantic and naive doctrines.’ And thus a philosopher comes to
traduce a friend,  thus a philosopher turns informer and
prostitutes his principles, thus a member of the Senate comes to
betray his beliefs. Inside, his real opinion cries out to be heard –
 no faint or timid idea, based on casual reasoning and hanging,
as it were, by a thread, but a strong and vital conviction rooted in
practical experience.
 Be careful how you take the news – I won’t say that your
child died, because you couldn’t possibly tolerate that -but that your
cruet of oil fell over. Or that someone drank up all your wine. 
Anyone nding you in despair might well say, simply, ‘Philosopher,
you sang a dierent tune in school. Don’t try to deceive us, or
pretend that you are a human being when you’re no more than a
worm.’  I’d like to come upon one of them having sex, just to
see how much they exert themselves and what kind of sounds they
make; whether they remember who they are or recall any of the
sentiments which they hear and preach and read.
 What has any of this to do with freedom? On the contrary,
nothing except this relates to freedom, whether rich people such as
you choose to believe it or not.
 ‘What proof do you have of that?’
Only you yourselves, with your abject reverence for your great
master, the emperor, whose every nod and gesture you live by. You
faint if he even squints at you, and toady before the old men and
women of the court, saying, ‘I can’t possibly do that, I’m not
allowed.’  And why can’t you? Weren’t you just arguing with
me that you were free? ‘But Aprulla won’t let me.’ Tell the truth,
slave – don’t run away from your masters or refuse to acknowledge
them, don’t dare to invoke an emancipator when proofs of your
servitude are so manifest.
 I mean, someone constrained by love to act against their
better judgement, who sees the right thing to do but is powerless to
act on it, might be considered the more deserving of compassion
inasmuch as they are in the grip of a violent and, in some ways, a
supernatural force.  But what sympathy can you expect with
your passion for old men and women, as you wipe their nose and
wash their face, ply them with presents and nurse them when
they’re sick as if you are their slave – all the while praying for their
death and pestering their doctors to nd out if they are terminal yet
or not. Or when you kiss the hands of other people’s slaves, making
yourself the slave of slaves, all for the sake of these great and
glorious honours and oces – what can you expect then?
 So don’t parade before me in your pride because you are a
consul or a praetor – I know how you came by these oces, and
who presented them to you.  Speaking for myself, I would
rather be dead than owe my living to Felicio, having to put up with
his airs and his typical slave’s impertinence. I know what a slave is
like who has acquired inuence and self-importance.
 ‘Are you free, then?’
By God I wish I were, and I pray to be; but I still can’t face my
masters, I continue to value my poor body, I attach great
importance to keeping healthy – though it isn’t healthy at all.16
 But I can show you a free man, to satisfy your desire for an
exemplar. Diogenes17 – he was free. Why? Not because his parents
were free (they weren’t), but because he himself was. He had
eliminated any means to capture him, there was no opening to
attack or seize him in order to make him a slave.  Everything
he owned was disposable, and only temporarily attached. If you had
seized any of his possessions, he would have surrendered it to you
sooner than be pulled along behind it. If you had grabbed him by
the leg, he would have given up the leg; if you had seized his entire
body, the entire body would have been sacriced. The same with
family, friends and country: he knew where they had come from,
from whom, and on what terms.
 His true parents, the gods – these he never would have
dared sacrice; nor his real country, the world at large. He yielded
to no one in his zeal to serve and obey the gods, and there is no one
who would have sooner died for his country.  He did not care
for the mere appearance of acting on the world’s behalf; he
constantly bore in mind that events all have their source there and
happen for the sake of that universal homeland by the command of
God, who governs it. Observe, therefore, what he personally says
and writes:  ‘Here’s why, Diogenes, you are at liberty to speak
your mind to the Persian king as well as to Archidamus, king of the
Spartans.’18  Is it because he was of freeborn parentage? Sure,
and I suppose the reason all the citizens of Athens, Sparta and
Corinth could not address them as they pleased, but feared and
attered them instead, was that their parents all were slaves. 
So why did he enjoy this licence? ‘Because I don’t consider the body
to be my own, because I lack for nothing, and because the law19 is
the only thing I esteem, nothing else.’ That’s what enabled him to be
free.
 And just so you don’t think I choose as my exemplar of
freedom someone unencumbered by wife, children, friends, relatives
and the demands of citizenship, factors that could make one bend
and compromise, take for consideration Socrates, who had both wife
and children, but as if they were on loan. He had a country, to the
degree and in the manner called for; he had friends and relatives –
but all these were subordinate to the law and the need to obey it.20
 And so, when he was drafted to serve, he was the rst one
to leave home, and once on the line fought without any regard for
his life. Ordered by the tyrants to arrest Leon, he did not give a
thought to obeying, because he thought the act unlawful, even
knowing there was a chance he might die if he refused.  He
didn’t care; it was not his skin he wanted to save, but the man of
honour and integrity. These things are not open to compromise or
negotiation.
 Later, when he had to defend himself at risk of his life, he
did not comport himself like someone with a wife and children, but
as someone alone and unattached. And how did he behave when it
was time to drink the poison?  Given the opportunity to save
himself, with Crito urging him to go into exile for his children’s
sake, did he look upon this as the lucky pretext he needed to stay
alive? Hardly. He reected on the right thing to do, with no thought
or regard for anything else. In his own words, he didn’t want to save
the body, he wanted to preserve the element that grows and thrives
with every act of justice, the element that is diminished and dies by
injustice.21  Socrates does not save his life at the cost of
dishonour – Socrates, who resisted the Athenians’ call to bring an
illegal motion to a vote,22 deed the tyrants, and spoke so
memorably on the subject of virtue and character. Such a man is not
saved with dishonour;  an honourable death, not ight, is his
salvation. A good actor preserves his reputation not by speaking
lines out of turn but by knowing when to talk – and when to keep
quiet.
 So what will become of his children? ‘If I had run o to
Thessaly, you would have cared for them. If I go to Hades, will no
one be there to look after them?’ Note how he makes light of death,
and sports with the idea of it.  If it had been you or I, we
quickly would have rationalized our behaviour thus: ‘People who
wrong us should be paid back in kind,’ not failing to add, ‘If my life
is spared I will help many people, but dead I’m of no use to anyone.’
If we had to squeeze through a mousehole to escape, we would have
done it.  But how could we then have helped anyone, with our
friends still back in Athens?∗ If we had been helpful alive, wouldn’t
we have done people much more good by accepting death in the
appropriate time and manner?  Even now, long after Socrates’
death, the memory of what he did and said benets humanity as
much as or more than ever.
 Study this – these principles, these arguments – and
contemplate these models of behaviour, if you want to be free, and
your desire corresponds to the goal’s importance.  Don’t be
surprised if so great a goal costs you many a sacrice. For love of
what they considered freedom men have hanged themselves, have
thrown themselves over clis – and whole cities have occasionally
been destroyed.  For true, inviolable, unassailable freedom,
yield to God when he asks for something back that he earlier gave
you. Prepare yourself, as Plato says,23 not just for death, but for
torture, exile, ogging – and the loss of everything not belonging to
you.  You will be a slave among slaves otherwise; even if you
are a consul ten thousand times over, even if you make your
residence on the Palatine,24 you will be a slave none the less.
And you’ll realize, as Cleanthes used to say, that what
philosophers say may be contrary to expectation, but not to reason.
 For you will learn by experience that it’s true: the things that
men admire and work so hard to get prove useless to them once
they’re theirs. Meanwhile people to whom such things are still
denied come to imagine that everything good will be theirs if only
they could acquire them. Then they get them: and their longing is
unchanged, their anxiety is unchanged, their disgust is no less, and
they still long for whatever is lacking.  Freedom is not
achieved by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it.  Assure
yourself of this by expending as much eort on these new ambitions
as you did on those illusive goals: work day and night to attain a
liberated frame of mind.  Instead of a rich old man, cultivate
the company of a philosopher, be seen hanging around his door for a
change. There’s no shame in the association, and you won’t go away
unedied or empty-handed, provided you go with the right attitude.
Try at least; there is no shame in making an honest eort.
IV 2 On social intercourse
 You should be especially careful when associating with one of
your former friends or acquaintances not to sink to their level;
otherwise you will lose yourself.  If you are troubled by the idea
that ‘He’ll think I’m boring and won’t treat me the way he used to,’
remember that everything comes at a price. It isn’t possible to
change your behaviour and still be the same person you were
before.
 So choose: either regain the love of your old friends by
reverting to your former self or remain better than you once were
and forfeit their aection.  And if you choose the latter, stick to
it from here on out. Don’t give in to second thoughts, because no
one who wavers will make progress. And if you are committed to
making progress and ready to devote yourself to the eort, then give
up everything else.  Otherwise your ambivalence will only ensure
that you don’t make progress, and you won’t even get to revisit the
pleasures of the past.
 Formerly, when you were devoted to worthless pursuits, your
friends found you congenial company.  But you can’t be a hit in
both roles. To the extent you cultivate one you will fall short in the
other. You can’t seem as aable to your old cronies if you don’t go
out drinking with them as of old. So choose whether you want to be
a charming drunk in their company, or dull and sober on your own.
You can’t expect the same reception from the group you used to
associate with if you don’t go carousing with them regularly any
more.
So again you have a choice:  if you value dignity and restraint
over being called a ‘sport’ by your old mates, then forget other
considerations, renounce them, walk away and have nothing more
to do with that crowd.  If you don’t like that, then commit to the
opposite course with all your heart. Join the louche set, become one
of the degenerates – do as they do and indulge your every impulse
and desire. Jump around and yell at a musical performance, what’s
to stop you now?
 Such dierent roles don’t mix. You can’t play the part of
both Thersites and Agamemnon. If you want to be Thersites, you
should be bald and crippled. Agamemnon needs to be tall and
handsome, and a leader with a genuine love for the people under his
command.
IV 3 What to aim for in exchange for what
 If you forfeit an external possession, make sure to notice what
you get in return. If it is something more valuable, never say, ‘I have
suered a loss.’  It is no loss if you get a horse in return for an
ass, cattle for sheep, a kind act for a little money, real peace in place
of idle chatter, decency in exchange for vulgarity.
 Bear this in mind and you will everywhere preserve your
proper character; forget it and I assure you that your time here will
be a waste, and whatever care you are now expending on yourself
will all go down the drain.  Very little is needed for everything to
be upset and ruined, only a slight lapse in reason.  It’s much
easier for a mariner to wreck his ship than it is for him to keep it
sailing safely; all he has to do is head a little more upwind and
disaster is instantaneous. In fact, he does not have to do anything: a
momentary loss of attention will produce the same result.
 It’s much the same in our case. If you doze o, all your
progress up to that point will be negated.  So keep a sharp eye on
your impressions, and never fall asleep. It is no small thing that is
being watched over, it equates with honesty, trustworthiness and
stability. It is freedom from passion, grief, fear and consternation –
it is freedom itself.
 What are you going to get when you trade your freedom
away? Check to see what your proud new possessions will be worth.
‘But I won’t be getting anything like it in return.’
If you go ahead and get it anyway, consider again what you are
getting for it.  ‘I have self-control, he has a tribuneship; he has a
generalship, I have my honour. I don’t scream and yell when to do
so would be rude; and I won’t jump up out of my seat where such
behaviour would be out of place. I am free and a friend of God,
whom I obey willingly.  I do not claim possession over anything
that does not belong to me, not the body, not possessions, not
power, not fame – nothing. Because God does not want me
competing for such things. Had he wished it, he would have made
them good for me. But he has not done that. And I must not ignore
his orders.’
 Guard what is good for you always; make wise use of
material things for as long as they are granted you to enjoy, and be
content with virtue exclusively. Otherwise you will meet with bad
luck, disappointment and frustration at every turn.
 These are the laws that have been sent to us from God, the
directives you should be trying to learn – not the statutes of Cassius
and Masurius.25
IV 4 To those intent on living quietly
 Remember, it isn’t just desire for power and money that makes a
man humble and deferential towards others, but also desire for the
opposite – for a life of peace and quiet, of travel and scholarship. It
is a general rule that externals of any kind, if we attach importance
to them, make us subject to somebody.  It makes no dierence
whether we wish to be a senator, or wish not to be one; whether we
desire to have oce, or to avoid it; whether we say, ‘I can’t do
anything, unfortunately, I’m tied to my books like a sti,’ or, ‘Sadly,
I have no leisure for study.’  A book is an external, just like oce
or public honours.  Why do you want to read anyway – for the
sake of amusement or mere erudition? Those are poor, fatuous
pretexts. Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it
doesn’t make you peaceful, what good is it?
 ‘But it does help with that – which is exactly why I regret
being deprived of it.’
What kind of peace is this that is so easily shattered – not by the
emperor or even by a friend of the emperor, but by a crow, a street
musician, a cold, or a thousand other annoyances? True peace is
characterized by nothing so much as steadiness and
imperturbability.
 Now I am being called upon for some purpose. I answer the
call determined to observe the right limits; to act with restraint, but
also with condence, devoid of desire or aversion towards externals.
 At the same time I observe other people’s words and actions –
not maliciously, in order to judge or ridicule them, but to better
assess whether I engage in any of the same behaviour. ‘How should I
stop, then?’ ‘Once I was liable to the same mistakes, but, thanks to
God, no longer…’∗
 Well, isn’t it just as worthwhile to have devoted and applied
yourself to this goal as to have read or written fty pages? After all,
when you are eating, you don’t wish you were reading, you are
content to be eating in a manner consistent with the principles you
learned from your reading; likewise when you bathe or exercise. 
So be consistent in other respects – when you meet Caesar, or when
you meet some random passer-by. If you keep yourself calm, poised
and dignied,  if you observe rather than are observed, if you
don’t envy people with greater success, don’t let externals disconcert
you – if you do all this, what more do you need?  Books? Yes,
but how, or for what purpose?
‘Isn’t reading a kind of preparation for life?’
But life is composed of things other than books. It is as if an
athlete, on entering the stadium, were to complain that he’s not
outside exercising.  This was the goal of your exercise, of your
weights, your practice ring and your training partners. You want
them now that the time to exploit them has arrived?  Or it’s as
if, in the matter of assent, when faced with impressions, instead of
distinguishing which ones are convincing and which are not, we
prefer to read a book entitled On Comprehensive Impressions.
 So what accounts for such behaviour? The fact that our
reading and our writing have never aimedat using inconformity
with nature the impressions that we encounter in real life. Instead, it
is enough for us to learn what is written on the topic and be able to
explicate it before someone else; it is enough if we can analyse an
argument or develop a hypothesis.
 Consequently, there is bound to be frustration when you
exert yourself. You desire what is not in your control: ne, but be
prepared to be refused, to be frustrated, to come up empty-handed.
 If, on the other hand, we read books entitled On Impulse not
just out of idle curiosity, but in order to exercise impulse correctly;
books entitled On Desire and On Aversion so as not to fail to get what
we desire or fall victim to what we would rather avoid; and books
entitled On Moral Obligation in order to honour our relationships and
never do anything that clashes or conicts with this principle; 
then we wouldn’t get frustrated and grow impatient with our
reading. Instead we would be satised to act accordingly. And
rather than reckon, as we are used to doing,  ‘How many lines I
read, or wrote, today,’ we would pass in review how ‘I applied
impulse today the way the philosophers recommend, how I desisted
from desire, and practised aversion only on matters that are under
my control. I wasn’t ustered by A or angered by B; I was patient,
restrained and cooperative.’ That way we will be able to thank God
for things that we truly should be grateful for.
 As it is, though, we fail to realize how little we dier from
the mass of men, the only dierence being that they are afraid they
will not hold oce, while you are afraid you will. Don’t act that
way;  if you must laugh at someone who is anxious that he
won’t hold oce, then laugh at yourself as well. Someone suering
from rabies and afraid of water is no better o than someone
suering from fever and ready to drain the ocean dry.  If you
would dictate to circumstance, how can you emulate Socrates, who
said, ‘If it pleases the gods, so be it’?
Do you think Socrates would have been as ready to serve on so
many campaigns if he had longed to linger in the Academy or the
Lyceum every day, conversing with young men? No, he would have
groused and grumbled, ‘Hell, here I am in misery when I might be
back in the Lyceum sunning myself.’ Is that your job, sunning
yourself?  Isn’t it rather to be happy, unappable and equal to
every occasion? How could he have remained Socrates, had he
yielded to disaection? How would he have been the same man
who wrote hymns of praise behind prison walls?26
 Just keep in mind: the more we value things outside our
control, the less control we have. And among things outside our
control is not only access to, but relief from, public oce; not just
work, but leisure too.
 ‘So now I have to live my life among the mob?’ The mob?
You mean crowds? What’s wrong with crowds? Imagine you’re at
Olympia, in the middle of the festival, where you will likewise nd
some people shouting while others conduct business on the side,
and everywhere people are jostling one another. The baths, too, are
a madhouse. Yet which of us does not enjoy the party, and regret
when it’s time to leave?  Don’t grow peevish about trivialities.
‘The vinegar is bad, it’s sharp; the honey’s bad, it upsets my
constitution; I didn’t like the vegetables.’
 Similarly, someone says, ‘I don’t like leisure, it’s boring; I
don’t like crowds, they’re a nuisance.’ But if events ordain that you
spend time either alone or with just a few other people, look upon it
as tranquillity and play along with it for the duration. Talk to
yourself, train your thoughts and shape your preconceptions. If, on
the contrary, you happen upon a crowd, call it a sporting event, a
festival or celebration,  and try to keep holiday with the people.
What could better please a person who loves his fellow man than
the sight of them in numbers? We like to see herds of cows or
horses, we delight in the sight of a eet of boats; why hate the sight
of a gathering of human beings?
 ‘But they deafen me with their shouting.’
So your hearing is oended; what does it have to do with you?
Your power of using impressions isn’t diminished, is it? Who can
keep you from using desire and aversion, or choice and refusal, in
conformity with nature? No mob is big enough for that.
 Just keep in mind the central questions: ‘What is mine, what
is not mine? What has been given to me? What does God want me
to do, or not do, now?’  It wasn’t long ago he wanted you to
take time o, to commune with yourself, to read, write and attend
classes on these subjects – all by way of preparation, because you
had the time available. Now, however, he’s saying to you, ‘It’s high
time you were tested. Show us what you’ve learned, show us how
well you’ve trained. How long do you plan on working out alone?
We want to know whether you are champion material or a touring
professional pushover.  So don’t make diculties, no public
match is devoid of commotion. There have to be trainers,
supporters, many judges and many people in the stands.’
 ‘But I was hoping to lead a peaceful life.’
Well, then, mope and be miserable, as you should be. What
greater punishment do you deserve for ignoring and defying God’s
will than to be sad, disgruntled and malcontent -unhappy, in short,
and ill-fated? Don’t you want to be free of all that?
 ‘But how can I do it?’
You’ve often heard how – you need to suspend desire completely,
and train aversion only on things within your power. You should
dissociate yourself from everything outside yourself – the body,
possessions, reputation, books, applause, as well as oce or lack of
oce. Because a preference for any of them immediately makes you
a slave, a subordinate, and prone to disappointment.  Keep
Cleanthes’ verse handy:
Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny.
Do I have to go to Rome? Then I go to Rome. To Gyara? All right, I
go to Gyara instead. To Athens? Then Athens it is. To jail? Well then
I go to jail.  But if you ever think, ‘When do we get to go to
Athens?’ you are already lost. Either you’re going to be depressed
when your wish is not realized or foolishly pleased with yourself if
it is, overjoyed for the wrong reasons. And next time, if you’re not
so lucky, you’ll grow disconsolate when events are not so much to
your liking.  Give them all up.
‘But Athens is lovely.’
It would be lovelier still if you could secure happiness, free of
emotion, poised and dependent on no one except yourself.
‘And Rome is all crowds and sycophancy.’
 But the reward for enduring such inconveniences is peace. So
if this is the time for them, why not conquer your aversion? Why
endure them like a donkey hit by sticks?  Otherwise, look, you
will always have to serve the person who is able to secure your
release, or the person who can block your way. You will have to
serve him the way you would an evil deity.
 There is one road to peace and happiness (keep the thought
near by morning, noon and night): renunciation of externals;
regarding nothing as your own; handing over everything to fortune
and the deity. Leave those things in the care of the same people God
appointed to govern them,  while you devote yourself to the
one thing that is truly yours and that no one can obstruct; make that
the focus of all your reading, your writing and your lecture
attendance.
 I cannot call somebody ‘hard-working’ knowing only that
they read and write. Even if ‘all night long’ is added, I cannot say it
– not until I know the focus of all this energy. You don’t call
someone ‘hard-working’ who stays up nights with their girlfriend.
No more do I.  If the goal is glory, I call them ambitious; if it’s
money, I call them avaricious.  If, however, their eorts aim at
improving the mind, then – and only then – do I call them hardworking.  Never praise or blame people on common grounds;
look to their judgements exclusively. Because that is the
determining factor, which makes everyone’s actions either good or
bad.
 Bearing all this in mind, welcome present circumstances and
accept the things whose time has arrived.  Be happy when you
nd that doctrines you have learned and analysed are being tested
by real events. If you’ve succeeded in removing or reducing the
tendency to be mean and critical, or thoughtless, or foul-mouthed,
or careless, or nonchalant; if old interests no longer engage you, at
least not to the same extent; then every day can be a feast day –
today because you acquitted yourself well in one set of
circumstances, tomorrow because of another.
 How much better cause is this to celebrate than becoming
consul or governor; because you have yourself to thank, and the
gods. Remember, then, who is responsible for the gift, to whom it
was given, and for what reason.  With these thoughts, can you
doubt where your future happiness lies, or how you will best please
God? Is it not the same distance to God everywhere? Are not events
equally visible from every vantage point?
IV 13 To those who lightly share personal
information
 Whenever we think that someone has spoken frankly about their
personal aairs, somehow or other we are impelled to share our
secrets with them too and think this is being honest;  in the rst
place, because it seems unfair that we should hear news from our
neighbour, and not share with them some news of our own; and
secondly, because we imagine that we won’t make a forthright
impression if we keep our personal aairs condential.  People
often say, in fact, ‘I have told you everything about myself, while
you won’t share with me anything about your life; why?’ 
Additionally, we believe that it is safe to conde in someone who
has already entrusted us with private information, on the
assumption that they would never betray our secrets lest we betray
theirs –  which is just how incautious people are entrapped by
soldiers in the capital. A soldier in civilian dress sits down beside
you and begins to criticize the emperor. Then you, encouraged to
trust them by the fact that they initiated the conversation, open up
on this score too. Next thing you know you are being hauled o to
prison in chains.27
 Something similar happens in our everyday life. We keep one
person’s secrets, and likewise share our own with whomever. 
But I don’t divulge what I’ve been told in condence (if, indeed, I
am so honourable), whereas the other person goes o and blabs to
all and sundry. Now, if I am like him, after nding out what’s
happened I want to get even and proceed to spill his secrets, hurting
him and myself in the process.  If, on the other hand, I remind
myself that one person cannot harm another, but it is rather our
own actions that help or harm each of us, then I refrain from acting
similarly. My own thoughtlessness was the cause of the trouble to
begin with.
 ‘Yes, but it’s unfair to receive the condences of your
neighbour and not share anything of your own with him.’
 Did I invite your condences, sir? Did you open up to me
solely on condition that you would get to hear my secrets?  Just
because you are so stupid as to suppose that everyone you meet is
your friend, why expect me to do likewise? You were right to trust
me with your secrets, whereas you cannot well be trusted with
mine; should I then be indiscreet?  It’s as though I owned a
watertight jug, while you had one with a hole in it, and you came
and left your wine with me to store in my jug, and then got angry
because I didn’t deposit my wine with you – in your leaky jug, that
is.
 So how can an exchange between us still be considered fair?
You made a deposit with someone trustworthy and high-minded,
someone who only regards his personal actions, not externals, as
good or bad.  Do you want me to make a deposit with you –
you who don’t value your character, but only want to earn money,
or an oce, or advancement at court – even if you have to sacrice
your children to get it, like Medea?  What’s fair about that? Just
prove to me that you are trustworthy, high-minded and reliable, and
that your intentions are benign – prove to me that your jar doesn’t
have a hole in it – and you’ll nd that I won’t even wait for you to
open your heart to me, I’ll be the rst to implore you to lend an ear
to my own aairs.  Who, after all, wouldn’t want to make use of
a sound vessel, who doesn’t welcome a friendly and reliable
counsellor, who wouldn’t gladly invite someone to share his
problems as he would share his burden, and lighten it by the very
act of sharing?
 ‘Fine. But I have faith in you, and you don’t have faith in
me.’
First of all, the reason you can’t keep anything to yourself is that
you’re a born loudmouth. If you really do trust me, show it by
conding in me alone.  As it is, however, you pull up a seat
alongside whoever is free and proceed to accost them. ‘Brother, I
have no one nearer or dearer to me than you, please listen to my
story.’ You say this to people whom you have barely known a week.
 Let’s suppose you do trust me. It must be because you think
I’m trustworthy and discreet – not because I’ve already shared with
you my private life.  So allow me to entertain the same opinion
of you. Show me that, if someone discloses his secrets to another, he
is therefore personally discreet and reliable. Well, if that were so, I
would go around telling everyone my story – if that would really
improve my character. But such is not the case; what we need are
judgements of a particular kind.  At any rate, if you see
someone fond of externals, someone who values them over their
own moral integrity, you can be sure that he is vulnerable to
thousands of people who can frustrate or coerce him.  There’s
no need of pitch or the wheel to force him to say what he knows; a
mere nod from a young woman is enough to get him to talk, a token
of favour from a partisan of Caesar, a longing for oce, the hope of
an inheritance – a thousand other such things in addition.
 In general, remember that sharing intimate details calls for
people of faithfulness and sound principles;  and how easy is it
to nd people of that description today? Just point out to me,
please, someone with the moral bre to say, ‘I’m only interested in
my own business, in what is inalienable, what is by nature free.
This, the essence of the good, I hold secure; as for the rest, let it be
as it is, it makes no dierence to me.’
FRAGMENTS
The ‘fragments’ are mostly brief quotations of passages not found
elsewhere in Epictetus’ extant writings. Fragment 9 purports to be taken
from ‘the fth book of Discourses’, which indicates that at least one
whole book has been lost, since only four survive. It is likely that some of
the other fragments also derive from this source – or perhaps from other
books of Discourses that have disappeared. Most of these fragments
(‘excerpts’ might be a better word) are preserved in an anthology of
writings, mainly on ethical topics, compiled in the fth century ad by
Johannes Stobaeus for the education of his son. Those with a dierent
provenance are indicated below by naming the alternative source.
For the text (and selection of fragments) I follow the Loeb edition
(Epictetus: The Discourses as Reported by Arrian, the Manual, and
Fragments, ed. W. A. Oldfather, 2 vols., London and Cambridge, Mass.,
1925–8), which is based in turn on the edition of Schenkl (Epicteti:
Dissertationes ab Arriano Digestae, ed. H. Schenkl, 2nd edn, Leipzig,
1916) with an additional fragment (28b).
1. What do I care whether matter is made up of atoms, indivisibles,
or re and earth? Isn’t it enough to know the nature of good and
evil, the limits of desire and aversion, and of choice and refusal, and
to use these as virtual guidelines for how to live? Questions beyond
our ken we should ignore, since the human mind may be unable to
grasp them. However easily one assumes they can be understood,
what’s to be gained by understanding them in any case? It must be
said, I think, that those who make such matters an essential part of
a philosopher’s knowledge are creating unwanted diculties.
And what of the commandment at Delphi, to ‘know yourself’ – is
that redundant too? No, not that, certainly. Well, what does it
mean? If someone said to a chorus member ‘Know yourself,’ the
command would mean that he should give attention to the other
chorus members and their collective harmony. Similarly with a
soldier or sailor. So do you infer that man is an animal created to
live on his own, or in a community?
‘A community.’
Created by whom?
‘By nature.’
What nature is and how it governs everything, whether it is
knowable or not – are these additional questions superuous?∗
2. Whoever chafes at the conditions dealt by fate is unskilled in the
art of life; whoever bears with them nobly and makes wise use of
the results is a man who deserves to be considered good.
3. Everything obeys and serves the universe1
 – the land and sea, the
sun and other stars, as well as the world’s plants and animals. Our
body also obeys it in both sickness and health (whichever it
dictates), in youth and old age, and in the course of the body’s other
changes. So it is unreasonable that our will, which is in our power,
be the only thing to try to resist it. It is stronger than we are and
very powerful indeed; besides, it has planned for us better than we
could ourselves by including us in its grand design. Resistance is
vain in any case; it only leads to useless struggle while inviting grief
and sorrow.
4.  Of things that are, God has put some under our control, some
not. The best and most important thing is under our control and the
basis of God’s own well-being – the use of external impressions.
Rightly used, this leads to freedom, serenity, happiness and
satisfaction; it is also the source of justice, law, restraint and virtue
in general. He did not put anything else under our control. So we
should support God by making the same distinction and doing
everything to lay claim to what is in our control, while surrendering
what is not to the care of the universe. Whether it asks for our
children, our homeland, our body or anything else, resign it
gracefully.
5. Which one of you does not admire what Lycurgus the Spartan2
said? He was blinded in one eye by a young citizen of Sparta, who
was then handed over to Lycurgus to punish as he saw t. Lycurgus
not only declined to exact revenge, he gave the youth an education
and made a good man of him. He then publicly introduced him at
the theatre. The Spartans were indignant, but Lycurgus said, ‘The
person you gave me was violent and aggressive; I’m returning him
to you civilized and rened.’
6. Above all, nature demands that we conform and adapt our will to
our idea of what’s right and useful.
7. To imagine that we will be despised by others unless we use
every means to inict harm, especially on our enemies, is typical of
very mean and ignorant people. We say that worthless people are
recognized by, among other things, their inability to do harm; it
would be much better to say that they’re recognized by their
inability to do anyone good.
8.  The nature of the universe was, is and always will be the same,
and things cannot happen any dierently than they do now. It’s not
just mankind and the other animals on earth that share in the cycle
of change, but also the heavens and even the four basic elements: up
and down they change and alternate, earth becoming water, water
air, and air in turn becoming re – with an analogous change from
above downwards.3
 If we try to adapt our mind to the regular
sequence of changes and accept the inevitable with good grace, our
life will proceed quite smoothly and harmoniously.
9.   [from Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights4
 XIX 1, 14-21 A renowned
Stoic philosopher drew from his satchel Book Five of the Discourses
of Epictetus, edited by Arrian, writings that undoubtedly agree with
those of Zeno and Chrysippus. There (translated from the Greek) we
nd a passage to this eect:
Impressions (which philosophers call), striking a person’s mind as
soon as he perceives something within range of his senses, are not
voluntary or subject to his will, they impose themselves on people’s
attention almost with a will of their own. But the act of assent
(which they call) which endorses these impressions is voluntary and
a function of the human will. Consequently, when a frightening
noise comes from heaven or in consequence of some accident, if an
abrupt alarm threatens danger, or if anything else of the kind
happens, the mind even of a wise man is inevitably shaken a little,
blanches and recoils – not from any preconceived idea that
something bad is about to happen, but because certain irrational
reexes forestall the action of the rational mind.
Instead of automatically assenting to these impressions (i.e. these
frightening mental images), however (that is), our wise man spurns
and rejects them, because there is nothing there that need cause him
any fear.5 And this, they say, is how the mind of the wise man
diers from the fool’s: the latter believes that impressions
apparently portending pain and hardship when they strike his mind
really are as they seem, so he approves (the word the Stoics use
when discussing this matter) them and accepts that he should fear
them as if this were self-evident. But the wise man, soon regaining
his colour and composure, (does not assent), rearms his support of
the view he’s always had about such impressions – that they are not
in the least to be feared, but are only supercially and speciously
frightening.
10.  [from Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights XVII 19 According to
Favorinus,6
 Epictetus said that most apparent philosophers were
philosophers ‘not in their actions, only their words’. A more incisive
form of the idea was committed to writing in the books that Arrian
composed based on Epictetus’ lectures: ‘Whenever,’ Arrian writes,
‘Epictetus noticed a person with no sense of shame but plenty of
misplaced energy, vicious in character but possessed of a ready
tongue, concerned with everything to the exclusion of his soul,
whenever (he says) he saw such a character apply himself to any of
various philosophical disciplines – taking up physics, studying logic,
exploring various abstract topics of this sort – he’d be moved to cry
out, invoking both gods and men, and in the course of his appeal
would address these remarks to the person: “Friend, where are you
storing all this erudition? Consider whether the receptacle is clean.
If it’s being added to the vessel of vague opinion, it’s as good as lost.
And if it spoils, it will turn into urine, vinegar or something even
worse.” ’
There is absolutely nothing truer than these words, or more
important; the greatest of philosophers thus implies that the
writings and teachings of philosophy, when emptied into someone
vicious and a fake – as into a foul and lthy vessel – become
spoiled, degraded, and debased, turning into urine (as he says, in
rather Cynic style) or, if it’s possible, something even more
disgusting.
According to Favorinus, Epictetus would also say that there were
two vices much blacker and more serious than the rest: lack of
persistence and lack of self-control. The former means we cannot
bear or endure hardships that we have to endure, the latter means
that we cannot resist pleasures or other things we ought to resist.
‘Two words,’ he says, ‘should be committed to memory and obeyed
by alternately exhorting and restraining ourselves, words that will
ensure we lead a mainly blameless and untroubled life.’ These two
words, he used to say, were ‘persist and resist’.
10a. [from Arnobius, Against the Pagans7
 II 78 When the health of
our soul and our self-respect is at stake, even irrational measures are
justied, as Arrian quotes Epictetus saying, with approval.
11. Archelaus8
 invited Socrates to his court with the promise of
wealth. But Socrates reported back that ‘In Athens four quarts of
barley meal can be bought for a penny, and there are plenty of
springs of fresh water. If my means are slight, still I can manage on
them, which makes them adequate for my purposes.’ Can’t you see
that Polus performed Oedipus as a king no more pleasingly or
eloquently than he played Oedipus as a beggar and wanderer?9
Then won’t the good man make as ne a showing as Polus by
performing well in every costume in which destiny dresses him?
Shouldn’t he imitate Odysseus, who was no less dignied wearing
rags than in his royal purple robe?10
12. There are some quietly temperamental people who coldly and
calmly act the same way as people wholly carried away by anger.
Their vice should be avoided too as it is much worse than being
boiling mad; people of the latter sort soon get their satisfaction,
whereas the former hold on to their anger like patients with a lowgrade fever.
13. ‘But,’ someone objects, ‘I see good people dying of cold and
hunger.’
Well, don’t you see wicked people dying of luxury, pride and
excess?
‘Yes, but it’s demeaning to depend on others for one’s living.’11
Who is really self-sucient, fool – apart from the universe itself?
In any case, to object to providence on the grounds that the wicked
go unpunished since they are rich and powerful is like saying that, if
they lost their sight, they escaped punishment since they still had
their ngernails intact. Personally, I say that virtue is more valuable
than wealth to the same degree that eyes are more valuable than
ngernails.
14.  Let’s question those gloomy philosophers12 who say that
pleasure is not itself in agreement with nature but a mere byproduct
of the things in agreement with nature, like justice, self-control and
freedom. Why, then, does the soul delight and ‘nd content’, as
Epicurus says, in the goods of the body, fragments which are
supposed to be inferior, but not take pleasure in its own (supposedly
superior) goods? Well, nature has also endowed mewith a sense of
shame, and I blush deeply whenever I catch myself saying anything
disgraceful. It’s this reex that will not allow me to propose pleasure
as the good and the goal of life.
15. Women in Rome thumb Plato’s Republic because it advocates for
the community of women. They attend only to the letter, not the
spirit, which was not to encourage one man and one woman to
marry and move in together – with the idea that women would then
be shared – but to do away with that sort of marriage and introduce
a dierent kind. People in general love to cite authority as a pretext
to indulge their vices – when we know that philosophy says we
should not even extend a nger without good reason.13
16.  We should realize that an opinion is not easily formed unless a
person says and hears the same things every day and practises them
in real life.
17. When we are guests at a dinner party, we content ourselves with
the food on oer; if anyone were to tell the host to put out sh or
cake, he would seem rude. In real life, however, we ask the gods for
what they do not give, and this though they have provided us with
plenty.
18. It is just charming how people boast about qualities beyond
their control. For instance, ‘I am better than you because I have
many estates, while you are practically starving’; or, ‘I’m a consul,’
‘I’m a governor,’ or ‘I have ne curly hair.’ One horse doesn’t say to
another, ‘I’m better than you because I have lots of hay and barley,
my reins are of gold, and my saddle is embroidered,’ but ‘I’m better
because I’m faster than you.’ Every animal is judged better or worse
based on its particular virtue or defect. Is man the only creature
lacking a virtue, that we have to take account of his hair, his
clothes, or his ancestry?
19.  People who are physically ill are unhappy with a doctor who
doesn’t give them advice, because they think he has given up on
them. Shouldn’t we feel the same towards a philosopher – and
assume that he has given up hope of our ever becoming rational – if
he will no longer tell us what we need (but may not like) to hear?
20.  People with a strong physical constitution can tolerate extremes
of hot and cold; people of strong mental health can handle anger,
grief, joy and the other emotions.
21.  It is only right to praise Agrippinus, who never praised himself,
although he was a man of the highest character. If he was praised by
anyone else, he only became embarrassed. He was more inclined to
praise every diculty he faced: if he had a fever, he composed a
paean to fever, if he faced exile or disgrace he would celebrate
those. Once, when he was preparing for lunch, a messenger arrived
from Rome announcing that Nero had sentenced him to exile.
Unustered he replied, ‘Then why don’t we just move our lunch to
Aricia.’14
22.  When he was governor, Agrippinus tried to convince the people
whom he sentenced that it was for their own good to be sentenced.
‘I don’t at all condemn them in a spirit of malice,’ he said, ‘much
less with an eye to seizing their property. I act in a spirit of concern
and good will, like a doctor who comforts the patient whom he
plans to cut open, and cajoles him into submitting to the operation.’
23.  Nature is amazing and ‘on the side of life’, as Xenophon says.15
Take the body – the nastiest and least pleasant thing of all – which
we nevertheless love and look after. If we had to look after our
neighbour’s body, we’d be sick of it inside of a week. Imagine what
it would be like to rise at dawn and brush someone else’s teeth, or
wipe their private parts after they’ve answered nature’s call. Really,
it’s amazing that we can love something that on a daily basis
requires so much of our attention.
I stu this paunch, then empty it; and what could be more
tedious? But God must be obeyed, and so I live on and put up with
washing, feeding and housing my miserable body. When I was
younger it asked something else of me, and I put up with that too.
So why can’t you tolerate it, when nature, which gave you this
body, asks for it back?
‘But I love it.’
Wasn’t it nature, as I just nished saying, that made you love it?
It’s nature, too, that tells you it’s time to let it go, so that you won’t
have to fuss over it any more.
24. Whenever someone dies young, they blame the gods because they
are being taken before their time; an old man who does not die also
blames the gods∗ for his ailments, because by now he ought to have
reached his resting place. Nevertheless, when death approaches he
wants to live and sends for the doctor, begging him to spare nothing
of his skill and energy. People are strange, Epictetus said: they
neither wish to live nor die.
25.  Whenever you set about attacking someone with violent
threats, remember to give them fair warning, because you are not a
savage animal. And if you refrain from savage behaviour, in the end
you will have nothing to regret or explain.
26. [from Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations16 IV 41 You are a bit
of soul carrying around a dead body, as Epictetus used to say.
27. [from Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations XI 37 Epictetus said
that we must nd a method for managing assent. In the eld of
assent we have to be careful to use it with reservation, with restraint
and in the service of society. Drop desire altogether and apply
aversion to nothing that is not under our control.
28. [from Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations XI 38 It is nothing
trivial at stake here, Epictetus said, but a question of sanity or
insanity.
28a. [from Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations XI 39 Socrates would
say, ‘What do you want? To have the souls of rational or irrational
animals?’
‘Rational.’
‘Healthy or unhealthy rational animals?’
‘Healthy’
‘Then why don’t you work at it?’
‘Because we have them already.’
‘Then why are you ghting and quarrelling with one another?’
28b. [from Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations IV 49, 2-6 ‘Poor me,
because this happened to me.’ No, say rather, ‘Lucky me, because
though this happened to me I’m still happy, neither broken by
present circumstance nor afraid for the future.’ Because the same
thing could have happened to anyone, but not everyone could have
remained content. So why is the former a misfortune any more than
the latter is a blessing? Do you actually call anything a human
misfortune that isn’t a perversion of human nature? And don’t you
think a perversion of human nature must run counter to nature’s
will? Well, you understand its will. So does this misfortune prevent
you in any way from being just, generous, sober, reasonable,
careful, free from error, courteous, free, etc. – all of which together
make human nature complete?
Remember from now on whenever something tends to make you
unhappy, draw on this principle: ‘This is no misfortune; but bearing
with it bravely is a blessing.’
ENCHIRIDION

 We are responsible for some things, while there are others for
which we cannot be held responsible. The former include our
judgement, our impulse, our desire, aversion and our mental
faculties in general; the latter include the body, material
possessions, our reputation, status – in a word, anything not in our
power to control.  The former are naturally free, unconstrained
and unimpeded, while the latter are frail, inferior, subject to
restraint – and none of our aair.
 Remember that if you mistake what is naturally inferior for
what is sovereign and free, and what is not your business for your
own, you’ll meet with disappointment, grief and worry and be at
odds with God and man. But if you have the right idea about what
really belongs to you and what does not, you will never be subject
to force or hindrance, you will never blame or criticize anyone, and
everything you do will be done willingly. You won’t have a single
rival, no one to hurt you, because you will be proof against harm of
any kind.
 With rewards this substantial, be aware that a casual eort is
not sucient. Other ambitions will have to be sacriced, altogether
or at least for now. If you want these rewards at the same time that
you are striving for power and riches, chances are you will not get
to be rich and powerful while you aim for the other goal; and the
rewards of freedom and happiness will elude you altogether.
 So make a practice at once of saying to every strong
impression: ‘An impression is all you are, not the source of the
impression.’ Then test and assess it with your criteria, but one
primarily: ask, ‘Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?’
And if it’s not one of the things that you control, be ready with the
reaction, ‘Then it’s none of my concern.’

 The faculty of desire purports to aim at securing what you want,
while a version purports to shield you from what you don’t. If you
fail in your desire, you are unfortunate, if you experience what you
would rather avoid you are unhappy. So direct aversion only
towards things that are under your control and alien to your nature,
and you will not fall victim to any of the things that you dislike. But
if your resentment is directed at illness, death or poverty, you are
headed for disappointment.
 Remove it from anything not in our power to control, and
direct it instead toward things contrary to our nature that we do
control. As for desire, suspend it completely for now. Because if you
desire something outside your control, you are bound to be
disappointed; and even things we do control, which under other
circumstances would be deserving of our desire, are not yet within
our power to attain. Restrict yourself to choice and refusal; and
exercise them carefully, with discipline and detachment.1

In the case of particular things that delight you, or benet you, or to
which you have grown attached, remind yourself of what they are.
Start with things of little value. If it is china you like, for instance,
say, ‘I am fond of a piece of china.’ When it breaks, then you won’t
be as disconcerted. When giving your wife or child a kiss, repeat to
yourself, ‘I am kissing a mortal.’ Then you won’t be so distraught if
they are taken from you.

Whenever planning an action, mentally rehearse what the plan
entails. If you are heading out to bathe, picture to yourself the
typical scene at the bathhouse – people splashing, pushing, yelling
and pinching your clothes. You will complete the act with more
composure if you say at the outset, ‘I want a bath, but at the same
time I want to keep my will aligned with nature.’ Do it with every
act. That way if something occurs to spoil your bath, you will have
ready the thought, ‘Well, this was not my only intention, I also
meant to keep my will in line with nature – which is impossible if I
go all to pieces whenever anything bad happens.’

It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning
them. Death, for example, is nothing frightening, otherwise it would
have frightened Socrates. But the judgement that death is
frightening – now, that is something to be afraid of. So when we are
frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves –
that is, our judgements – accountable. An ignorant person is
inclined to blame others for his own misfortune. To blame oneself is
proof of progress. But the wise man never has to blame another or
himself.

Don’t pride yourself on any assets but your own. We could put up
with a horse if it bragged of its beauty. But don’t you see that when
you boast of having a beautiful horse, you are taking credit for the
horse’s traits? What quality belongs to you? The intelligent use of
impressions. If you use impressions as nature enchiridion prescribes,
go ahead and indulge your pride, because then you will be
celebrating a quality distinctly your own.

If you are a sailor on board a ship that makes port, you may decide
to go ashore to bring back water. Along the way you may stop to
collect shellsh, or pick greens. But you always have to remember
the ship and listen for the captain’s signal to return. When he calls,
you have to drop everything, otherwise you could be bound and
thrown on board like the livestock.
So it is in life. If, instead of greens and shellsh, you have taken
on a wife and child, so much the better. But when the captain calls,
you must be prepared to leave them behind, and not give them
another thought. If you are advanced in years, don’t wander too far,
or you won’t make it back in time when the summons reaches you.

Don’t hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome
events in whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace.

Sickness is a problem for the body, not the mind – unless the mind
decides that it is a problem. Lameness, too, is the body’s problem,
not the mind’s. Say this to yourself whatever the circumstance and
you will nd without fail that the problem pertains to something
else, not to you.

For every challenge, remember the resources you have within you to
cope with it. Provoked by the sight of a handsome man or a
beautiful woman, you will discover within you the contrary power
of self-restraint. Faced with pain, you will discover the power of
endurance. If you are insulted, you will discover patience. In time,
you will grow to be condent that there is not a single impression
that you will not have the moral means to tolerate.

Under no circumstances ever say ‘I have lost something,’ only ‘I
returned it.’ Did a child of yours die? No, it was returned. Your wife
died? No, she was returned. ‘My land was conscated.’ No, it too
was returned.
‘But the person who took it was a thief.’
Why concern yourself with the means by which the original giver
eects its return? As long as he entrusts it to you, look after it as
something yours to enjoy only for a time – the way a traveller
regards a hotel.

 If you want to make progress, drop reections like: ‘I will end
up destitute if I don’t take better care of my aairs,’ or, ‘Unless I
discipline my slave, he’ll wind up good for nothing.’ It is better to
die of hunger free of grief and apprehension than to live auent
and uneasy. Better that your slave should be bad than that you
should be unhappy.
 For that reason, starting with things of little value – a bit of
spilled oil, a little stolen wine – repeat to yourself: ‘For such a small
price I buy tranquillity and peace of mind.’ But nothing is
completely free. So when you call your slave, be prepared for the
possibility that he might ignore you, or if he does answer, that he
won’t do what he’s told. He is not worth entrusting with your peace
of mind.

If you want to make progress, put up with being perceived as
ignorant or naive in worldly matters, don’t aspire to a reputation for
sagacity. If you do impress others as somebody, don’t altogether
believe it. You have to realize, it isn’t easy to keep your will in
agreement with nature, as well as externals. Caring about the one
inevitably means you are going to shortchange the other.

 You are a fool to want your children, wife or friends to be
immortal; it calls for powers beyond you, and gifts not yours to
either own or give. It is equally naive to ask that your slave be
honest; it amounts to asking that vice be not vice but something
dierent.2
 You can, however, avoid meeting with disappointment in
your desires; focus on this, then, since it is in the scope of your
capacities.  We are at the mercy of whoever wields authority
over the things we either desire or detest. If you would be free,
then, do not wish to have, or avoid, things that other people control,
because then you must serve as their slave.

Remember to act always as if you were at a symposium. When the
food or drink comes around, reach out and take some politely; if it
passes you by don’t try pulling it back. And if it has not reached you
yet, don’t let your desire run ahead of you, be patient until your
turn comes. Adopt a similar attitude with regard to children, wife,
wealth and status, and in time, you will be entitled to dine with the
gods. Go further and decline these goods even when they are on
oer and you will have a share in the gods’ power as well as their
company. That is how Diogenes, Heraclitus3
 and philosophers like
them came to be called, and considered, divine.

Whenever you see someone in tears, distraught because they are
parted from a child, or have met with some material loss, be careful
lest the impression move you to believe that their circumstances are
truly bad. Have ready the reection that they are not upset by what
happened – because other people are not upset when the same thing
happens to them – but by their own view of the matter.
Nevertheless, you should not disdain to sympathize with them, at
least with comforting words, or even to the extent of sharing
outwardly in their grief. But do not commiserate with your whole
heart and soul.

Remember that you are an actor in a play, the nature of which is up
to the director to decide. If he wants the play to be short, it will be
short, if he wants it long, it will be long. And if he casts you as one
of the poor, or as a cripple, as a king or as a commoner – whatever
role is assigned, the accomplished actor will accept and perform it
with impartial skill. But the assignment of roles belongs to another.4

If you hear a raven croak inauspiciously,5
 do not be alarmed by the
impression. Make a mental distinction at once, and say, ‘These
omens hold no signicance for me; they only pertain to my body,
property, family, or reputation. For me every sign is auspicious, if I
want it to be, because, whatever happens, I can derive some benet
from it.’

 You will never have to experience defeat if you avoid contests
whose outcome is outside your control.  Don’t let outward
appearances mislead you into thinking that someone with more
prestige, power or some other distinction must on that account be
happy. If the essence of the good lies within us, then there is no
place for jealousy or envy, and you will not care about being a
general, a senator or a consul – only about being free. And the way
to be free is to look down on externals.

Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you
must believe that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in
provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the
provocation. Whichis whyit is essential that wenot respond
impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you
will nd it is easier to maintain control.

Keep the prospect of death, exile and all such apparent tragedies
before you every day – especially death – and you will never have
an abject thought, or desire anything to excess.

If you commit to philosophy, be prepared at once to be laughed at
and made the butt of many snide remarks, like, ‘Suddenly there’s a
philosopher among us!’ and ‘What makes him so pretentious now?’
Only don’t be pretentious: just stick to your principles as if God had
made you accept the role of philosopher. And rest assured that, if
you remain true to them, the same people who made fun of you will
come to admire you in time; whereas, if you let these people
dissuade you from your choice, you will earn their derision twice
over.

If you are ever tempted to look for outside approval, realize that you
have compromised your integrity. So be satised just being a
philosopher, and if you need a witness in addition, be your own;
and you will be all the witness you could desire.

 Don’t let thoughts like the following disturb you: ‘I am going to
live a life of no distinction, a nobody in complete obscurity.’ Is lack
of distinction bad?∗ Because if it is, other people cannot be the
cause of it, any more than they can be the cause of another’s
disgrace. Is it solely at your discretion that you are elevated to
oce, or invited to a party? No; so it cannot be a dishonour if you
are not. And how can you be ‘a nobody in obscurity’ when you only
have to be somebody in the areas you control – the areas, that is,
where you have the ability to shine?
 But your friends, you say, will be helpless. If by ‘helpless’ you
mean that they won’t get money from you, and you won’t be able to
make them Roman citizens – well, whoever told you that
responsibility for such things belongs to us? Besides, who can give
another what he does not have himself? ‘Make money,’ someone
says, ‘so that we can all share in it.’  If I can make money while
remaining honest, trustworthy and dignied, show me how and I
will do it. But if you expect me to sacrice my own values, just so
you can get your hands on things that aren’t even good – well, you
can see yourself how thoughtless and unfair you’re being. Which
would you rather have, anyway – money, or a worthy and faithful
friend? So why not support me to that end, rather than asking me to
engage in behaviour that involves the loss of these qualities?
 ‘But my community will be helpless – to the extent that I can
help.’ Again, what kind of help do you have in mind? You can’t give
it buildings or baths, true, but so what? The blacksmith can’t give it
shoes, nor can the cobbler supply it with arms. It’s enough if
everyone plays their respective part. I mean, wouldn’t you benet
your community by adding another lawful and loyal citizen to its
rolls?
‘Yes.’
Then evidently you have it in you to benet it all on your own.
‘Well, what will my profession in the community be?’ Whatever
position you are equipped to ll, so long as you preserve the man of
trust and integrity.  If you lose that in your zeal to be a public
benefactor, what use in the end will you betothe community
onceyouhave beenrenderedshameless and corrupt?

 Someone was preferred above you at a formal dinner or awards
banquet, and their advice was solicited before yours. If such marks
of esteem are good, you should be pleased for the other person; if
they are not, don’t chafe because you did not get them. And
remember, if you do not engage in the same acts as others with a
view to gaining such honours, you cannot expect the same results.
 A person who will not stoop to attery does not get to have the
atterer’s advantages. One who dances attendance on a superior is
rewarded dierently from someone who sits out. Refuse to praise
someone and you cannot expect the same compensation as a
atterer. It would be unfair and greedy on your part, then, to
decline to pay the price that these privileges entail and hope to get
them free.
 How much is a head of lettuce worth? One obol, perhaps?
Now if someone pays an obol and gets the head of lettuce, while
you will not pay this much and therefore go without, don’t imagine
that you necessarily come o second best. As he has the lettuce, you
still have the money.  And it’s much the same in our case. You
were not invited to someone’s party, because you wouldn’t pay the
host the price of admission, namely paying her court and singing
her praises. So pay the bill, if you expect to gain by it, and give no
further thought to the expense. But if you won’t pay the bill and still
want the benets, you are not only greedy but a fool.  If you
forgo the meal, however, must it mean that you leave emptyhanded? You have the advantage of not having to praise the host,
which you nd disagreeable (and won’t have to put up with the
insolence of his slaves).

We can familiarize ourselves with the will of nature by calling to
mind our common experiences. When a friend breaks a glass, we are
quick to say, ‘Oh, bad luck.’ It’s only reasonable, then, that when a
glass of your own breaks, you accept it in the same patient spirit.
Moving on to graver things: when somebody’s wife or child dies, to
a man we all routinely say, ‘Well, that’s part of life.’ But if one of
our own family is involved, then right away it’s ‘Poor, poor me!’ We
would do better to remember how we react when a similar loss
aicts others.

Just as a target is not set up in order to be missed, so evil is no
natural part of the world’s design.

If your body was turned over to just anyone, you would doubtless
take exception. Why aren’t you ashamed that you have made your
mind vulnerable to anyone who happens to criticize you, so that it
automatically becomes confused and upset?

 Reect on what every project entails in both its initial and
subsequent stages before taking it up. Otherwise you will likely
tackle it enthusiastically at rst, since you haven’t given thought to
what comes next; but when things get dicult you’ll wind up
quitting the project in disgrace.  You want to win at the
Olympics? So do I – who doesn’t? It’s a glorious achievement; but
reect on what’s entailed both now and later on before committing
to it. You have to submit to discipline, maintain a strict diet, abstain
from rich foods, exercise under compulsion at set times in weather
hot and cold, refrain from drinking water or wine whenever you
want – in short, you have to hand yourself over to your trainer as if
he were your doctor. And then there are digging contests to endure,
and times when you will dislocate your wrist, turn your ankle,
swallow quantities of sand, be whipped – and end up losing all the
same.
 Consider all this, and if you still want to, then give athletics a
go. If you don’t pause to think, though, you’ll end up doing what
children do, playing at wrestler one minute, then gladiator, then
actor, then musician. And you – you’re an athlete now, next a
gladiator, an orator, a philosopher – but nothing with all your heart.
You’re like a monkey who imitates whatever it happens to see,
infatuated with one thing after another. You haven’t approached
anything attentively, or thought things through; your approach to
projects is casual and capricious.
 Some people, likewise, see a philosopher or hear someone like
Euphrates lecture (only, who can lecture like him?) and get it in
their heads to become philosophers too.  Listen, friend, research
the role, then assess your capacity to ll it, just as you assess your
arms, thighs and back if you hope to be a wrestler or pentathlete.
 We are not all cut out for the same thing. Do you think that as a
philosopher you can eat and drink, or exercise desire and aversion,
as you do at present? You have to stay up nights, put up with pain,
leave your family, be looked down on by slaves, suer ridicule from
strangers, be outdone in status, in power, in legal matters – get the
worst of it, in other words, down to the last little thing.  Ponder
whether you’re prepared to pay this price for serenity, freedom and
calm. If not, then don’t go near it – don’t, like children, be a
philosopher now, a tax ocer later, then an orator or politician.
These roles don’t mix; you have to be one person, good or bad. You
have to care either for your mind or for material things; specialize
in what is within you or without – which is to say, you have to stick
to the role of philosopher or layman.

Duties are broadly dened by social roles. This man is your father:
the relationship demands from you support, constant deference and
tolerance for his verbal, even his physical, abuse.
‘But he’s a bad father.’
Look, nature has endeared you to a father, not necessarily a good
one.
‘My brother is unfair to me.’
Well then, keep up your side of the relationship; don’t concern
yourself with his behaviour, only with what you must do to keep
your will in tune with nature. Another person will not hurt you
without your cooperation; you are hurt the moment you believe
yourself to be.
The titles of neighbour, citizen and general will likewise suggest
to you what functions they entail, once you begin to give social
relationships their due in your daily deliberations.

 Realize that the chief duty we owe the gods is to hold the
correct beliefs about them: that they exist, that they govern the
world justly and well, and that they have put you here∗ for one
purpose – to obey them and welcome whatever happens, in the
conviction that it is a product of the highest intelligence. This way
you won’t ever blame the gods or charge them with neglect.  And
this cannot happen unless you stop applying ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to
externals and only describe things under our control that way.
Because, if you regard any external as good or bad, and fail to get
what you want or get what you don’t want instead, you will blame
the gods and inevitably hate them for being the cause of your
trouble.
 Every living thing by nature shrinks and turns away from
whatever it considers harmful or malicious, just as it loves and
gravitates toward what is helpful and sympathetic. Anyone who
imagines that they are being wronged can no more love the oender
than the oence.  And so we nd even fathers being blamed by
their children, when they fail to give them what the child regards as
good. It is the same reason Polyneices and Eteocles became enemies
– the idea each had that it would be better to rule alone. It is why
farmers curse the gods; why sailors, traders and men who have lost
wives or children curse them too. Piety cannot exist apart from self-
interest. The upshot is, when you practise using desire and aversion
correctly, you practise being pious.
 At the same time, it is never wrong to make sacrice, pour
libations, or oer rst fruits in the traditional manner, as long as it
is done attentively and not carelessly or by rote, and you neither
oer too little nor spend beyond your means.

 In your approach to divination, bear in mind that you don’t
know what will happen, you go in order to learn it from the
prophet. A philosopher, however, arrives already knowing the value
of what’s to come. If it’s anything outside his sphere of inuence, he
knows it can be neither good nor bad.  So if you consult a
prophet, leave desire, fear, and aversion behind, in the assurance
that the future, per se, is indierent, and nothing to you. You can
make use of it, whatever it is, and there’s not a soul who can stop
you. Approach the gods with a dignied attitude, think of them as
your advisers. But once their advice has been given, remember the
source and consider who you would be slighting if you were to set
that advice aside.
 Make use of divination the way Socrates thought it should be
used,6
i.e. solely when it’s a matter of learning the future – not
when there’s a problem that can be resolved by the application of
reason (another human resource). Don’t, for example, resort to
divination if you are duty-bound to come to the defence of your
country or share in some danger threatening a friend. Suppose the
seer declares the omens unfavourable – which, in cases like this,
could spell exile for you, physical injury, even death. And still
reason demands that you stick by your friend, or help defend your
country. On that score we have only to consult the greatest prophet
of all, Apollo: he refused to let someone enter his temple who had
once ignored cries for help from a friend under assault from robbers.

 Settle on the type of person you want to be and stick to it,
whether alone or in company.
 Let silence be your goal for the most part; say only what is
necessary, and be brief about it. On the rare occasions when you’re
called upon to speak, then speak, but never about banalities like
gladiators, horses, sports, food and drink – commonplace stu.
Above all don’t gossip about people, praising, blaming or comparing
them.  Try to inuence your friends to speak appropriately by
your example. If you nd yourself in unfamiliar company, however,
keep quiet.
 Keep laughter to a minimum; do not laugh too often or too
loud.
 If possible, refuse altogether to take an oath; resist, in any
case, as far as circumstances will permit.
 Avoid fraternizing with non-philosophers. If you must,
though, be careful not to sink to their level; because, you know, if a
companion is dirty, his friends cannot help but get a little dirty too,
no matter how clean they started out.
 Where the body is concerned, take only what is strictly
necessary in the way of food, drink, clothing, shelter and household
slaves. Cut out luxury and ostentation altogether.
 Concerning sex, stay as chaste as you can before marriage. If
you do indulge, engage only in licit liaisons. Don’t be harsh or
judgemental towards others who have sex; if you are celibate
yourself, don’t advertise the fact.
 If you learn that someone is speaking ill of you, don’t try to
defend yourself against the rumours; respond instead with, ‘Yes, and
he doesn’t know the half of it, because he could have said more.’
 There is no call to be a regular at the public games. But if the
occasion should arise and you go, don’t be seen siding with anyone
except yourself; which is to say, hope only for what happens to
happen, and for the actual winner to win; then you won’t be
unhappy. Yelling, jeering and excessive agitation should be avoided
completely. Don’t talk much about the event afterwards, or any
more than is necessary to get it out of your system. Otherwise it
becomes obvious that the experience captivated you.
 Don’t too soon, or too lightly, attend other people’s lectures;
when you do go remain serious and reserved, without being
disagreeable.
 When you are going to meet someone, especially someone
deemed important, imagine to yourself what Socrates or Zeno would
have done in the situation and you won’t fail to get on, whatever
happens.  When you are going to the house of someone
inuential, tell yourself that you won’t nd them in, that you will be
locked out, that the door will be slammed in your face, that they
won’t give you the time of day. And, despite that, if it’s the right
thing to go, then go and face the consequences. Don’t say to yourself
later, ‘It wasn’t worth it.’ That’s the mark of a conventional person
at odds with life.
 In your conversation, don’t dwell at excessive length on your
own deeds or adventures. Just because you enjoy recounting your
exploits doesn’t mean that others derive the same pleasure from
hearing about them.
 And avoid trying to be funny. That way vulgarity lies, and at
the same time it’s likely to lower you in your friends’ estimation.
 It is also not a good idea to venture on profanity. If it
happens, and you aren’t out of line, you may even criticize a person
who indulges in it. Otherwise, signal your dislike of his language by
falling silent, showing unease or giving him a sharp look.

As with impressions generally, if you get an impression of
something pleasurable, watch yourself so that you are not carried
away by it. Take a minute and let the matter wait on you. Then
reect on both intervals of time: the time you will have to
experience the pleasure, and the time after its enjoyment that you
will beat yourself up over it. Contrast that with how happy and
pleased you’ll be if you abstain. If the chance to do the deed
presents itself, take extra care that you are not overcome by its
seductiveness, pleasure and allure. Counter temptation by
remembering how much better will be the knowledge that you
resisted.

If you decide to do something, don’t shrink from being seen doing it,
even if the majority of people disapprove. If you’re wrong to do it,
then you should shrink from doing it altogether; but if you’re right,
then why worry how people will judge you?

Just as the propositions ‘It is day’ and ‘It is night’ together
contribute much to disjunctive propositions, but nothing to
conjunctive ones,7
 so, even allowing that taking the largest portion
of a dish contributes to the health of the body, it contributes
nothing to the communal spirit that a dinner party should typify. So
when you dine in company, remember not only to consider what the
food on oer can do for your health, have some consideration for
your host’s good health too.

If you undertake a role beyond your means, you will not only
embarrass yourself in that, you miss the chance of a role that you
might have lled successfully.

As you are careful when you walk not to step on a nail or turn your
ankle, so you should take care not to do any injury to your character
at the same time.8
 Exercise such caution whenever we act, and we
will perform the act with less risk of injury.

Each man’s body denes the limit of his material needs, as, on a
small scale, the foot does with regard to shoes. Observe this
principle, and you will never be in any confusion as to what those
limits are. Exceed them, and you inevitably fall o a virtual cli. As
with shoes – if you don’t limit yourself to what the foot needs, you
wind up with gold heels, purple pumps or even embroidered
slippers. There’s no end once the natural limit has been exceeded.

At the age of fourteen girls begin to be addressed by men as ‘ladies’.
From this they infer that the world honours them for nothing so
much as their potential as sexual partners. Consequently, they
become preoccupied with their appearance to the exclusion of
everything else. They must be made to realize that they are entitled
to be called ‘ladies’ only insofar as they cultivate modesty and selfrespect.

It shows a lack of renement to spend a lot of time exercising,
eating, drinking, defecating or copulating. Tending to the body’s
needs should be done incidentally, as it were; the mind and its
functions require the bulk of our attention.

Whenever anyone criticizes or wrongs you, remember that they are
only doing or saying what they think is right. They cannot be
guided by your views, only their own; so if their views are wrong,
they are the ones who suer insofar as they are misguided. I mean,
if someone declares a true conjunctive proposition to be false, the
proposition is unaected, it is they who come o worse for having
their ignorance exposed. With this in mind you will treat your critic
with more compassion. Say to yourself each time, ‘He did what he
believed was right.’

Every circumstance comes with two handles, with one of which you
can hold it, while with the other conditions are insupportable. If
your brother mistreats you, don’t try to come to grips with it by
dwelling on the wrong he’s done (because that approach makes it
unbearable); remind yourself that he’s your brother, that you two
grew up together; then you’ll nd that you can bear it.

The following are non-sequiturs: ‘I am richer, therefore superior to
you’; or ‘I am a better speaker, therefore a better person, than you.’
These statements, on the other hand, are cogent: ‘I am richer than
you, therefore my wealth is superior to yours’; and ‘I am a better
speaker, therefore my diction is better than yours.’ But you are
neither wealth nor diction.

Someone bathes in haste; don’t say he bathes badly, but in haste.
Someone drinks a lot of wine; don’t say he drinks badly, but a lot.
Until you know their reasons, how do you know that their actions
are vicious? This will save you from perceiving one thing clearly,
but then assenting to something dierent.

 Never identify yourself as a philosopher or speak much to nonphilosophers about your principles; act in line with those principles.
At a dinner party, for instance, don’t tell people the right way to eat,
just eat the right way. Remember how Socrates so eaced himself
that people used to approach him seeking an introduction to
philosophers, and he would graciously escort them; that’s how
careless he was of the slight.  If conversation turns to a
philosophical topic, keep silent for the most part, since you run the
risk of spewing forth a lot of ill-digested information. If your silence
is taken for ignorance, but it doesn’t upset you – well, that’s the real
sign that you have begun to be a philosopher. Sheep don’t bring
their owners grass to prove to them how much they’ve eaten, they
digest it inwardly and outwardly bring forth milk and wool. So don’t
make a show of your philosophical learning to the uninitiated, show
them by your actions what you have absorbed.

When your body gets used to simple living, don’t preen over it; if
you’re a water drinker, don’t take every opportunity to announce it.
If you want to train for physical austerities, do it for yourself, not
for outsiders. Don’t embrace marble statues;9
 but if you happen to
be very thirsty, try taking some cold water in your mouth and
spitting it out – and don’t tell anyone.

 The mark and attitude of the ordinary man: never look for help
or harm from yourself, only from outsiders. The mark and attitude
of the philosopher: look for help and harm exclusively from
yourself.
 And the signs of a person making progress: he never criticizes,
praises, blames or points the nger, or represents himself as
knowing or amounting to anything. If he experiences frustration or
disappointment, he points the nger at himself. If he’s praised, he’s
more amused than elated. And if he’s criticized, he won’t bother to
respond. He walks around as if he were an invalid, careful not to
move a healing limb before it’s at full strength.  He has expunged
all desire, and made the things that are contrary to nature and in his
control the sole target of his aversion. Impulse he only uses with
detachment. He does not care if he comes across as stupid or naive.
In a word, he keeps an eye on himself as if he were his own enemy
lying in ambush.

Whenever someone prides himself on being able to understand and
comment on Chrysippus’ books, think to yourself, ‘If Chrysippus had
written more clearly, this person would have nothing to be proud
of.’ As for me, I care only about understanding nature, and
following its leads. So I look for someone to interpret nature for me,
and after hearing that Chrysippus can, I turn to him. So far, I have
no cause for conceit. When I nd that Chrysippus really can
interpret nature, it still remains for me to act on his suggestions –
which is the only thing one can be proud of. If I admire the
interpretation, I have turned into a literary critic instead of a
philosopher, the only dierence being that, instead of Homer, I’m
interpreting Chrysippus. But whenever people ask me to interpret
Chrysippus for them, I only feel shame that my actions don’t meet
or measure up to what he says.

Whatever your mission, stick by it as if it were a law and you would
be committing sacrilege to betray it. Pay no attention to whatever
people might say; this no longer should inuence you.

 How long will you wait before you demand the best of yourself,
and trust reason to determine what is best? You have been
introduced to the essential doctrines, and claim to understand them.
So what kind of teacher are you waiting for that you delay putting
these principles into practice until he comes? You’re a grown man
already, not a child any more. If you remain careless and lazy,
making excuse after excuse, xing one day after another when you
will nally take yourself in hand, your lack of progress will go
unnoticed, and in the end you will have lived and died
unenlightened.
 Finally decide that you are an adult who is going to devote
the rest of your life to making progress. Abide by what seems best as
if it were an inviolable law. When faced with anything painful or
pleasurable, anything bringing glory or disrepute, realize that the
crisis is now, that the Olympics have started, and waiting is no
longer an option; that the chance for progress, to keep or lose, turns
on the events of a single day.  That’s how Socrates got to be the
person he was, by depending on reason to meet his every challenge.
You’re not yet Socrates, but you can still live as if you want to be
him.

 The rst and most important eld of philosophy is the
application of principles such as ‘Do not lie.’ Next come the proofs,
such as why we should not lie. The third eld supports and
articulates the proofs, by asking, for example, ‘How does this prove
it? What exactly is a proof, what is logical inference, what is
contradiction, what is truth, what is falsehood?’  Thus, the third
eld is necessary because of the second, and the second because of
the rst. The most important, though, the one that should occupy
most of our time, is the rst. But we do just the opposite. We are
preoccupied with the third eld and give that all our attention,
passing the rst by altogether. The result is that we lie – but have
no diculty proving why we shouldn’t.

 In every circumstance we should have the following sentiments
handy:
Lead me, Zeus, lead me, Destiny, To the goal I was long ago assigned
And I will follow without hesitation. Even should I resist, In a spirit of
perversity, I will have to follow nonetheless.
 Whoever yields to necessity graciously We account wise in God’s
